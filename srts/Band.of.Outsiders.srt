BAND OF OUTSI DERS

3
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:51,825
WITH THE LAST (?) SCORE EVERWRITTEN
FORTHE SCREEN BY MICHEL LEGRAND

4
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:38,907
- We almost there?
- Yeah. Straight ahead.

5
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,515
Any news from Thompson & Sons?

6
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,548
Nothing.

7
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,751
They stopped hiring yesterday.

8
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:52,358
They say business is bad.

9
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,195
What's with you?

10
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:57,959
You scared?

11
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,565
You think people have X-ray eyes?

12
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,777
This is no time to get the jitters.

13
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:11,174
Paris and its goddamn manhole covers!

14
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:29,428
There she is!

15
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:41,243
My story begins here.

16
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:44,113
Two weeks after meeting Odile,

17
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,016
Franz drove Arthur out
to show him the house.

18
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,092
The kid's a looker.

19
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,228
Yeah, I told you so.

20
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,995
She didn't seem to recognize you.

21
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:00,336
No need to tell her we were out here.

22
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,908
Why not? It's a free country.

23
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,445
So where is this joint?

24
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,209
Coming up.

25
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,741
It's cold and forsaken here.

26
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,307
That where she lives?

27
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:46,982
Odile? No.

28
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:50,884
She lives out back at the gardener's,
I think.

29
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,314
The woman lives in the house.

30
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,048
Really?

31
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,057
Maybe Odile, too.

32
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:00,496
We'll ask her later.

33
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:03,691
We'll ask her later.

34
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,736
Turning to look at the house
through the screen of trees,

35
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:10,666
they saw a cold, shimmering light,

36
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,899
like some distant star.

37
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:16,510
Arthur wanted to speak
but was at a loss for words.

38
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,514
She said he locks his bedroom door?

39
00:05:21,852 --> 00:05:25,288
You never let up.
She's not even allowed in.

40
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:29,190
See that?

41
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:31,756
Someone with the old lady.

42
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:33,960
Who is that guy?

43
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:36,564
The guy Odile mentioned,

44
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,325
the one from Monte Carlo or Moscow.

45
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:44,833
You cozy with Odile?

46
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,738
No, not yet. Why?

47
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,370
I'll have her when I want her.

48
00:05:56,853 --> 00:05:59,788
We'll come back here
after English class.

49
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,721
Right there, under those trees!

50
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,519
- Don't mind me.
- I'm not kidding.

51
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:07,558
On July 13, 1891,

52
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:09,928
Billy the Kid was shot in the back

53
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:13,569
by the sheriff ofTombstone,
Pat Garrett.

54
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,395
Let me drive.

55
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,192
Step on it or she'll be there before us.

56
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:45,891
This better work out.

57
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:06,613
The Austerlitz sun rose
over the Bastille.

58
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:10,725
Had Franz really stroked Odile's knee?

59
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:13,694
Yes, Franz said,
and that she had soft skin.

60
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,632
For latecomers arriving now,

61
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:00,469
we offer a few words
chosen at random:

62
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:03,737
Three weeks earlier. Apile of money.
An English class.

63
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:07,515
A house by the river.
A romantic girl.

64
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:28,636
LOUI'S SCHOOL

65
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:01,161
Your card.

66
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,608
I left mine at home.

67
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:09,711
I recognize you.

68
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:28,023
My notebook!

69
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,331
What did I just say, Mr. Remoleux?

70
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,172
Franz?

71
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:43,903
"Let's go to work."

72
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,604
Martine?

73
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:47,674
How?

74
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:56,954
Happily?

75
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,666
You know that the director, Mr. Loui,

76
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:08,770
is an advocate of modern methods.

77
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:11,299
But we mustn't forget...

78
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,738
that...

79
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:21,878
CLASSIC = MODERN

80
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:24,681
For...

81
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,947
as the great poet Eliot said...

82
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,450
Odile, what did Eliot say?

83
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,021
"Everything that is new

84
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:41,260
is thereby automatically traditional."

85
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,747
You needn't know how to say

86
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,384
"Where is the station?"
Or "A room with a bath."

87
00:10:55,852 --> 00:11:00,050
You need to know
how to spell "Thomas Hardy."

88
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:10,127
Or "Shakespeare."

89
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:19,700
I'm going to read a passage
from Romeo and Juliet.

90
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,944
You'll translate back into English.

91
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:30,245
It'll be a good yardstick.

92
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,619
Won't it, Franz?

93
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,729
What do you call
what we're about to do?

94
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,495
Translation.

95
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:48,904
Why don't you take off your coat?

96
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:52,141
I don't have my jacket.
Everything's at the cleaner's

97
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,276
and I don't have any money.

98
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:14,729
"Go, get thee hence,

99
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:17,592
for I will not away.

100
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:23,330
What's here?

101
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:26,304
A cup closed in my true love's hand?

102
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:34,145
Poison, I see,
hath been his timeless end.

103
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:43,092
O, churl, drunk all, and left
no friendly drop to help me after?

104
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,358
I will kiss thy lips.

105
00:12:56,506 --> 00:13:00,374
Haply some poison yet hangs on them
to make me die.

106
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,477
Let me die!"

107
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:14,848
"The ground is bloody.

108
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:16,548
Search about the churchyard.

109
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:20,752
Go, some of you,
whoe'er you find attach.

110
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,826
Pitiful sight!

111
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:30,129
Here lies the county slain,

112
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:33,269
And Juliet bleeding,
warm and newly dead,

113
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:36,570
Who here hath lain
these two days buried.

114
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:42,042
Go, tell the prince.

115
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:46,180
We see the ground whereon
these woes do lie,

116
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,286
but the true ground which we cannot
without circumstance descry."

117
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,157
"A thousand times the worse...

118
00:13:56,866 --> 00:14:01,565
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light.

119
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:05,038
Love goes toward love,

120
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:09,802
as schoolboys from their books.

121
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:18,182
But love from love,

122
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:24,059
Toward school with heavy looks."

123
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,959
TOU BI OR NOT TOU BI
AGAI NST YOUR BREAST,

124
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:34,730
IT IZ ZE QUESTION.

125
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,976
"In fair Verona,
where we lay our scene,

126
00:14:43,846 --> 00:14:47,304
a pair of star-cross'd lovers

127
00:14:47,884 --> 00:14:49,647
take their life.

128
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:54,255
The fearful passage
of their death-mark'd love

129
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:57,719
is now the two hours' traffic

130
00:14:57,994 --> 00:15:00,895
of our stage."

131
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:10,161
YOU LOOK OLD-FASHIONED
WITH YOUR HAI R LI KE THAT

132
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,437
"Romeo:

133
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:14,969
True, I talk of dreams,

134
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:18,045
Which are the children
of an idle brain,

135
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:21,048
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,

136
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:24,351
Which is as thin of substance
as the air,

137
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,420
More inconstant than the wind,

138
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,615
Who woos
the frozen bosom of the north.

139
00:15:29,826 --> 00:15:32,158
And, being angered,

140
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:37,463
Puffs away from thence, turning
his face to the dew-dropping south."

141
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,338
"Juliet:

142
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:55,910
My mind misgives some consequence

143
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:59,387
Yet hanging in the stars

144
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:03,083
Shall bitterly begin its fearful date

145
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:06,051
With this night's revels

146
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:11,189
And expire the term
of a despised life closed in my breast

147
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:14,559
By some vile forfeit
of untimely death."

148
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,452
"O, fortune!

149
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:40,621
All men

150
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:45,793
call thee fickle."

151
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,826
I'll collect your papers now.

152
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,344
A 10-minute break
while I correct them.

153
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:04,049
Miss...

154
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:10,218
How do you say
"A big, one-million dollar film?"

155
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:28,636
- I looked for you downstairs.
- That's typing class.

156
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,373
This is Odile.

157
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:34,209
How are you?

158
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:58,436
You really want to learn English?

159
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,539
If I were you, I'd drop the course.

160
00:18:01,811 --> 00:18:04,143
What do you mean, drop the course?

161
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:07,773
I'm just talking.

162
00:18:08,451 --> 00:18:10,009
I'm fed up.

163
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:12,585
It's impossible to get anywhere.

164
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:15,121
Don't let it get you down.

165
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:18,052
- Arthur.
- What?

166
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,793
My name's Arthur.

167
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,507
Is something wrong?

168
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:41,143
Something unusual, Arthur?

169
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,648
Why unusual?

170
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:46,287
Aren't ordinary troubles enough?

171
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:48,457
You have troubles?

172
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:50,281
Don't you?

173
00:18:52,128 --> 00:18:55,723
Madame Victoria wants me
to learn a practical trade.

174
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,858
She wants me to be a nurse.

175
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:02,304
But I don't want to.

176
00:19:02,772 --> 00:19:04,967
I was in a hospital once.

177
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,232
It was horrible.

178
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,476
I could never do that.

179
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:13,673
I haven't the patience or kindness.

180
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,743
So now you're learning English.

181
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:19,113
Oh, it's very exciting.

182
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:21,648
Know what I'd have done?

183
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:25,487
I would have been a nurse.

184
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:30,065
Then I'd have found
some rich old fogey to nurse,

185
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:33,065
help him get a little sicker each day,

186
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,533
while treating him with kindness,

187
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:38,435
to inherit his fortune once he's dead.

188
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:41,538
That's an awful thing to say.

189
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,072
True.

190
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:57,316
Did I spook you?

191
00:19:57,526 --> 00:19:59,585
Yes, but never mind.

192
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,194
You coming?

193
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,130
Go without me.

194
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:08,393
I'll meet you afterwards.
- No, I have to get home.

195
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:11,502
Madame Victoria
will be annoyed if I don't.

196
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:15,003
What if there was an extra class?

197
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:17,579
For specialized English.

198
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,806
Would you stay? She wouldn't mind.

199
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:21,880
But there isn't any.

200
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:24,647
She'd never know.

201
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,354
Fine. Very good.

202
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:36,062
You bet.

203
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,792
Great.

204
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:39,898
Sure, sure.

205
00:20:40,069 --> 00:20:41,434
What?

206
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:44,902
Obey your old bag
and make me feel rotten.

207
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:48,703
You coming or not?

208
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:54,913
You talk like I betrayed you.

209
00:20:58,053 --> 00:20:59,782
Everybody's gone back in.

210
00:21:00,156 --> 00:21:02,283
You'll be late, Odile.

211
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,823
But what could we do?

212
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,723
There's no time for dinner
or dancing or things like that.

213
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:12,024
I'll drive you home?

214
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:16,060
I'd rather take my bike.

215
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,203
We'll take it.

216
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:20,975
Why do you insist
on taking me home?

217
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:23,672
I dunno.

218
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:27,608
We can sit in the car awhile.

219
00:21:27,817 --> 00:21:29,375
Listen to the radio.

220
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:33,054
I'm not allowed to do things like that.

221
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,150
- Ever kiss a guy?
- Sure I have.

222
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:41,993
You know how?

223
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:44,864
Sure, with the tongue.

224
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:52,167
Okay, then.

225
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:54,070
Let's do it.

226
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:06,654
Go in and say you have a headache.

227
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:09,016
Tell Franz to do the same.

228
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:11,183
Is he coming with us?

229
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:15,957
See you downstairs
in 10 minutes in the car.

230
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:21,193
How do you know I'll come?

231
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:24,501
Now it's nine minutes and 56 seconds.

232
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:41,681
Oh, after all...

233
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,985
We might digress now

234
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:46,789
and describe how Odile, Franz
and Arthur each felt.

235
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:49,063
But that's pretty clear.

236
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:52,890
So we'll let the images
speak for themselves...

237
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,860
After all, screw it all.

238
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:58,901
Know what "screw" means?

239
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:01,632
- No, what?
- Then don't say it.

240
00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:05,604
Is this your Simca?

241
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:12,152
Someday I'll buy
a 24-cylinder Ferrari

242
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:14,222
and race it at Indianapolis.

243
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:16,356
Then you'll see.

244
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:21,291
You sure the money's at the villa?

245
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:23,627
I don't know.

246
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,525
What's with you?

247
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:28,960
Changed your mind all of a sudden?

248
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:45,050
So, changed your mind?
- About what?

249
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,648
About us stealing the money.

250
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:51,416
You have to be nuts to say that.

251
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,760
Completely crazy.

252
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:55,588
So I dreamt it all.

253
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:59,598
You're the one who told us.
We never asked you anything.

254
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:01,596
No, I didn't.

255
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:04,532
I mentioned it to Franz just to talk.

256
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,175
- Then it's not true?
- No, it's true, but...

257
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:11,069
You can't do it.
That would be insane.

258
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:16,982
What are you thinking?

259
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,289
You're like a girl in a book I read.

260
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:23,286
I'll give it to you.

261
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:27,862
You'll like it
and you won't betray me again.

262
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,088
Sure.

263
00:24:29,231 --> 00:24:31,597
Don't hold your breath.

264
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:38,104
Cold?

265
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,331
No, I'm trembling.

266
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:42,576
With excitement.

267
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:01,492
They saw a barren-looking island,

268
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:04,458
flanked, like life's ramparts,

269
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,328
by the contours of a horribly steep
and dismal bluff.

270
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,566
Vegetation invaded
the desolate prospect,

271
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:13,865
its blackness recalling
the Sea of the Dead.

272
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:44,501
Are we outside the city limits?

273
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:47,804
I've never really known.

274
00:25:48,343 --> 00:25:50,743
They once called it
the Isle of Ravens.

275
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:52,880
Not staying in the car?

276
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:55,608
We'll find some quiet place to talk.

277
00:25:56,785 --> 00:26:00,277
I'll take a bus back. I have practice.

278
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:04,050
I'll see if Madame Victoria's in.
I'll go back with you.

279
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:06,754
Then I'll stay since she's going.

280
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,929
But I'll be back, I said.

281
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,927
It won't be your first lie.

282
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:17,768
Not at all.

283
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,000
I'll say I'm going shopping.

284
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:25,072
Who lives in the house?

285
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:27,976
- At the villa, you mean?
- Where else?

286
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,276
There's Mr. Stolz.

287
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,384
He's there sometimes
but I've never seen him.

288
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,849
Then there's Madame Victoria and me,
plus the gardener.

289
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:42,090
He around a lot?

290
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:44,462
I don't know.

291
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,965
He ever try to paw you?

292
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,138
You're nuts! He's very well-behaved.

293
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,806
So you have seen him.

294
00:26:51,907 --> 00:26:54,705
- Is the money his or hers?
- It's not hers.

295
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:58,435
- Why does he hide it?
- I don't know.

296
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:01,812
I don't know.

297
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:05,113
Maybe he's cheating on his taxes.

298
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:09,081
You got me all wrong.

299
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:12,556
He robs the government
and deserves to be robbed himself.

300
00:27:14,696 --> 00:27:17,722
So will you wait? I'll be back.

301
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,335
Okay. We'll wait behind the factory.

302
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,333
Okay.

303
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:31,941
The girl's an idiot!

304
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:21,996
Aunt Victoria!

305
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,532
I'm here.

306
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,320
You'll never win at Indianapolis!
Never!

307
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,826
Got that?

308
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:01,900
You'll never win, I tell you!

309
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:05,163
Odile!

310
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:28,611
- I'll win!
- It's me, Odile and South America!

311
00:30:28,824 --> 00:30:32,191
- Here I am.
- Is Mr. Stolz's driver here?

312
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:36,127
- No one's around.
- What a nuisance. He's always late.

313
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:58,080
No answer. One of these days
the boss will have a fit.

314
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,612
What boss?

315
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:02,280
Mr. Stolz?

316
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:04,049
Still seeing that boy?

317
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:05,920
What boy?

318
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:07,953
Franz?

319
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:10,087
No, he dropped the course.

320
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:14,063
He says England's done for
and it's the Chinese who'll win.

321
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:16,467
So he's studying Chinese.

322
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:20,232
Someday I'll check
that you're not going to the movies.

323
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:21,639
I hate movies.

324
00:31:21,743 --> 00:31:24,211
- The theater, then.
- I hate theater.

325
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:28,246
- Or dancing at Mimi Pinson's.
- I hate that, too.

326
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:30,348
Or strolling on the boulevards.

327
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:32,109
I hate the boulevards.

328
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,481
What do you love, then?

329
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:36,281
I don't know.

330
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:39,360
I love nature.

331
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:44,091
Where are you going?

332
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:46,963
To a reception at the Albanian Embassy.

333
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:56,869
I'm taking 1,000 francs
to do some shopping.

334
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:58,946
1,000 francs...

335
00:32:30,545 --> 00:32:33,105
Been in Mr. Stolz's room
today or yesterday?

336
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:36,680
Me? I never go in there.

337
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:40,014
How strange.

338
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:43,750
Something's out of place.
I missed it this morning.

339
00:32:44,459 --> 00:32:46,950
Maybe he moved the furniture around.

340
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:48,925
Not at all.

341
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:53,500
Did he say he wanted his coat cleaned?

342
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:59,235
That must be it. He forget to tell us.

343
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,079
I'll ask him about it.

344
00:33:10,285 --> 00:33:12,651
Have a nice evening. I'm off.

345
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:50,585
"Tragedy of Disappointed Love!

Myriam, 21, stabs her artist lover

347

in his studio in southern Paris.

348
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,328
He'd wanted to be alone."

"Orleans -A third man holds
the key to the killings.

from Jacqueline,

who was later found dead
with her baby.

Hello, boy!

No appetite?

366
00:35:21,783 --> 00:35:23,512
Don't want it?

Franz!

375
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:53,999
- Over here!
- How much money did she say?

376
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:57,973
A big pile, she said.
Maybe 40 or 50 wads of bills.

377
00:36:58,179 --> 00:37:00,147
Could be 200 million.

378
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:02,975
Still, I wonder why she told me.

379
00:37:03,118 --> 00:37:05,348
She's not all there.

380
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,287
Why call Franz and not me?

381
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:13,620
It's dumb, but I forgot your name.

382
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:15,589
Is it Alfred or Arthur?

383
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:20,201
Drive me to Vincennes.
It's cold. I'll take the Metro.

384
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:22,528
Good idea.
We'll work out a plan in a café.

385
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:24,637
Why a plan?

386
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,402
A thought crossed Odile's mind
like a dark cloud:

387
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:34,914
Arthur would always look at her

388
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,244
like a shadow masking his view,

389
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,923
as if an ocean of indifference
lay between them.

390
00:39:09,744 --> 00:39:12,144
- You having what?
- A Coca-Cola.

391
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:16,574
"You-hav-ing-what? Co-ca-Co-la."
It doesn't rhyme.

392
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,014
I'll have a peppermint soda.

393
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,111
A schnapps and a Coca-Cola.

394
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:23,552
And a peppermint soda!

395
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:34,633
You seem to be having dark thoughts.

396
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:36,634
You said it.

397
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:40,837
Well, I saw it.

398
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:43,168
- Saw what?
- The money.

399
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:47,313
When I first told you about it,
I hadn't seen it.

400
00:39:48,082 --> 00:39:51,711
But now I have.
There's too much. I'm scared.

401
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,051
So this time, it's for real.

402
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:58,018
Why did you tell him?
That was a lousy thing to do.

403
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:02,455
Got 20 francs?

404
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:04,493
Give.

405
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,972
He guessed it.
I didn't say a thing.

406
00:40:16,744 --> 00:40:19,804
This isn't your first lie either.

407
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:23,608
He tell you he killed
his grandma with a hammer?

408
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:26,945
- Really?
- No. Second lie.

409
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:30,923
- Why'd you say that?
- To scare you.

410
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,017
There's a run in your stocking.

411
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:03,456
No, there isn't.

412
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,964
What were you two saying?

413
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:16,059
Just talking about the weather.

414
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:22,235
- Tell me where his room is.
- Whose room?

415
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,339
Mr. Stolz.

416
00:41:27,015 --> 00:41:29,916
So where is it?
On the second floor?

417
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:32,381
Does he lock the door?

418
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:35,117
But I'm not allowed to go in.

419
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:39,250
- How much is there?
- I don't know.

420
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:41,462
I told you already.

421
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:44,498
Don't be afraid.

422
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:46,664
You should've counted it.

423
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:49,266
Think big.
- I don't want to.

424
00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:51,631
Then you shouldn't have told us.

425
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,608
You're a drag.

426
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:57,076
You're our accomplice now.

427
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:04,148
Don't cry.

428
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,120
Now that we love each other,

429
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:13,719
everything will be fine.

430
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:15,758
Franz will help us.

431
00:42:16,297 --> 00:42:18,891
Better to be rich and happy
than poor and unhappy.

432
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:24,838
- We could do it tonight?
- Not tonight.

433
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:27,140
Mr. Stolz should be back.

434
00:42:27,842 --> 00:42:29,241
Tomorrow.

435
00:42:29,377 --> 00:42:32,278
He has a reception.
Tomorrow or the day after.

436
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:35,179
It's the day after, I think, yes.

437
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:37,976
Is it yes or no?

438
00:42:42,757 --> 00:42:45,282
Day after tomorrow, then.

439
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:47,489
Be right back.

440
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:01,398
Strange that his room's unlocked.

441
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:02,906
Not at all.

442
00:43:03,077 --> 00:43:06,911
Sometimes things are best hidden
in full view of everyone.

443
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:10,148
I read an American book
where that happened.

444
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:13,042
The police were looking for a letter.

445
00:43:13,254 --> 00:43:15,950
The thief left it lying on the table.

446
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:44,241
KEEP YOURYOUTHFUL EYES

447
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:54,118
"It's not only your looks,
but your happiness, too.

448
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:56,592
Good eye care depends on you."

449
00:44:01,836 --> 00:44:03,895
- Hurry up.
- Get lost.

450
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,601
Join us, miss?

451
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:14,010
- Got connections at Renault?
- No, why?

452
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:18,242
Too bad. You could've traded in
your dumb looks for a car.

453
00:44:41,175 --> 00:44:42,802
So what do we do now?

454
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,502
What do we do?

455
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,376
I don't know.

456
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,711
Or rather, I say I don't know,
but I do know.

457
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:57,547
Hand me that thing in my coat.

458
00:44:58,459 --> 00:45:00,859
In the pocket.

459
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:02,995
This?

460
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:06,791
Look.

461
00:45:08,536 --> 00:45:11,061
Put your hand around the ball.

462
00:45:15,409 --> 00:45:17,240
Nothing's happening.

463
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:20,979
The liquid should flow
to the other side.

464
00:45:27,855 --> 00:45:29,322
Okay.

465
00:45:29,523 --> 00:45:33,050
If there's nothing to say,
let's have a minute of silence.

466
00:45:33,494 --> 00:45:35,826
You can really be dumb sometimes.

467
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:40,033
A minute of silence
can be a long time.

468
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:44,261
A real minute of silence
takes forever.

469
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:47,332
Okay. One, two, three...

470
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:27,510
That's enough.
I'll put a record on.

471
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:37,013
Why is Franz staying?
Does he go everywhere with you?

472
00:46:40,394 --> 00:46:42,988
In case anyone takes a shot at you.

473
00:46:43,097 --> 00:46:46,362
It's like in the movies.
He'd make a good shield.

474
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:49,028
What a horrible thing to say.

475
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:56,509
Shall we dance?

476
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:58,473
Sure. What?

477
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,811
No, I prefer this.

478
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:06,183
Okay, let's go.

479
00:47:12,993 --> 00:47:17,828
Empires crumble, republics founder.

480
00:47:17,932 --> 00:47:21,424
But fools go on.
- Bravo, Mr. Segalot. That's real furniture!

481
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:12,179
Now is the time for a digression

482
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,412
in which to describe
our heroes'feelings.

483
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:33,470
Arthur keeps watching his feet,

484
00:48:33,707 --> 00:48:36,835
but his mind's on Odile's mouth
and her romantic kisses.

485
00:48:53,294 --> 00:48:55,421
Odile is wondering if the boys notice

486
00:48:55,663 --> 00:48:58,632
her breasts moving under her sweater.

487
00:49:13,414 --> 00:49:15,382
Franz thinks of everything and nothing.

488
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,751
He wonders if the world
is becoming a dream

489
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:21,419
or if the dream
is becoming the world.

490
00:50:52,313 --> 00:50:55,373
Arthur tossed a coin
to see who'd get Odile.

491
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:56,948
He called heads.

492
00:50:57,051 --> 00:50:59,918
Odile yelled heads,
the coin showed tails.

493
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:05,057
Franz took the car and drove around,
sad and lonely, his gaze feverish.

494
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:08,285
Meanwhile, on the city outskirts,
Arthur told Odile

495
00:51:08,395 --> 00:51:11,262
how he once met a fellow
who walked this way...

496
00:51:28,015 --> 00:51:30,483
What's your family name, Arthur?

497
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:32,384
Rimbaud.

498
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:34,119
Like my father.

499
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:37,921
That little old man
who was spying on us?

500
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,122
That's my uncle. My father's dead.

501
00:51:43,097 --> 00:51:45,759
How much is the Mauser?
- Two francs.

502
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:57,344
How would you feel if a live man

503
00:51:57,444 --> 00:52:00,413
was in your sights, like in battle?

504
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:05,009
I feel that if there was one,

505
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,610
right now he'd be dead.

506
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:11,423
Let's go home.

507
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:14,425
Don't take advantage of me.
I love you.

508
00:52:14,628 --> 00:52:16,095
Can I have my target?

509
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:19,357
Already?
- Lightning struck.

510
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,532
Arthur said such love talk was crap.

511
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,674
Odile said she'd blurted it out
but meant it.

512
00:52:33,147 --> 00:52:35,445
Then they walked down to Place Clichy,

513
00:52:35,883 --> 00:52:39,614
one of the loveliest squares at night.

514
00:52:40,487 --> 00:52:43,422
It brought them back
to the present, the past,

515
00:52:44,058 --> 00:52:46,322
and their intrepid future.

516
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:55,858
Whereupon they went down
into the center of the earth.

517
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:44,710
You change girlfriends often?

518
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:48,982
What makes you say that?

519
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,854
Franz said you had
a different girl every day.

520
00:54:09,643 --> 00:54:11,668
What do you see in me?

521
00:54:12,846 --> 00:54:14,871
And you in me?

522
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:21,047
I don't know.

523
00:54:22,422 --> 00:54:24,481
A husband.

524
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:35,531
Is that what interests you?

525
00:54:43,677 --> 00:54:46,202
What exactly does it mean to you?

526
00:54:51,518 --> 00:54:55,477
It means offering your breasts
and your thighs.

527
00:55:06,133 --> 00:55:10,467
People in the Metro
always look so sad and lonely.

528
00:55:14,808 --> 00:55:17,709
Look at that one.
Why that expression?

529
00:55:18,712 --> 00:55:20,839
It's whatever you imagine.

530
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:23,940
His look will change
depending on your story.

531
00:55:24,484 --> 00:55:27,976
Say he's taking a teddy bear home
to his sick daughter

532
00:55:28,188 --> 00:55:29,985
and he'll seem okay.

533
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:32,351
But he'll look mean

534
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:36,156
if you think he's carrying TNT
to blow up the country.

535
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:41,334
It reminds me of a song.

536
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:43,632
How does it go again?

537
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:47,265
I saw so many depart like that

538
00:55:48,008 --> 00:55:50,476
All they'd ask for was a light

539
00:55:51,378 --> 00:55:53,505
They settled for so little

540
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:57,044
They had so little anger in them

541
00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:02,346
I hear their steps, I hear their voices

542
00:56:03,123 --> 00:56:05,557
Speaking of things quite banal

543
00:56:06,894 --> 00:56:09,226
Like things you read in the papers

544
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:11,058
Like things you say evenings at home

545
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,963
What are they doing to you,
men and women

546
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:20,832
You tender stones
worn down too soon

547
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:24,744
Your appearances broken

548
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:28,345
My heart goes out at the sight of you

549
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:31,340
Things are what they are

550
00:56:32,452 --> 00:56:35,319
From time to time
the earth trembles

551
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,457
Misfortune only misfortune resembles

552
00:56:39,893 --> 00:56:42,657
So deep, so deep, so deep

553
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:47,095
You long to believe in blue skies

554
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:49,701
It's a feeling I know quite well

555
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:53,366
I still believe at certain times

556
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:57,108
I still believe, I must admit

557
00:56:58,211 --> 00:57:01,078
But I can't believe my ears

558
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:05,112
Oh, yes, I'm very much your peer

559
00:57:05,919 --> 00:57:09,787
I am just the same as you

560
00:57:11,725 --> 00:57:14,626
Like you, like a grain of sand

561
00:57:14,928 --> 00:57:17,761
Like the blood forever spilt

562
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:21,666
Like the fingers always wounded

563
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:24,469
Yes, I am your fellow creature

564
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,670
- And what's your family name?
- Odile Monod.

565
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:32,104
Like it?
- It's the wrong tone.

566
00:57:32,312 --> 00:57:34,644
- What tone?
- Monod-tone.

567
00:57:36,116 --> 00:57:37,708
See you.

568
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:42,015
- When do I see you again?
- Tomorrow night.

569
00:57:44,057 --> 00:57:47,424
- It's too risky.
- You love me. So tomorrow.

570
00:57:51,231 --> 00:57:55,895
Had Franz been there, he'd have
understood the look behind the glass.

571
00:57:56,136 --> 00:57:59,037
Her mind was on events, not men.

572
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,642
The mystery ofher face
would only strike him afterward.

573
00:58:04,344 --> 00:58:07,211
For now, the present was ordinary.

574
00:58:07,514 --> 00:58:09,778
"Racing. Monaco: 5-2."

575
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:13,812
- Who's that girl?
- Screw you.

576
00:58:14,054 --> 00:58:16,079
Don't talk like that to me.

577
00:58:17,758 --> 00:58:21,250
- Where'd you meet her?
- Dunno. In an English class.

578
00:58:21,495 --> 00:58:24,760
- Where does she live?
- Out nearJoinville.

579
00:58:24,998 --> 00:58:27,364
Tell her we need that money.

580
00:58:27,834 --> 00:58:29,927
Get plastered at Chaillot,
you madwoman!

581
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:31,764
Roger!

582
00:58:47,554 --> 00:58:51,354
- Don't mess with me. I did Indochina.
- Okay, I'll explain.

583
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:54,458
As a cease-fire,
Arthur told his uncle

584
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:57,724
he'd do thejob with them
the next night.

585
00:58:57,931 --> 00:59:01,389
He swore not to tell Franz or Odile.

586
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:40,037
The situation's clear enough.

587
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:44,869
But what isn't clear

588
00:59:46,947 --> 00:59:49,211
is the part I personally

589
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:51,373
have to play in it.

590
01:00:22,215 --> 01:00:24,308
We have to do it tonight.

591
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:26,112
Wasn't it tomorrow?

592
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:28,413
We'll pick up Odile on the way.

593
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:40,765
Why tonight? Isn't that risky?

594
01:00:41,134 --> 01:00:43,500
You shouldn't have blabbed
to my uncle.

595
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:45,633
Me? Blab what?

596
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:47,636
Dunno. Just hurry up.

597
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:52,235
The hell with it.
But it's gotta be tonight.

598
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:02,452
Hurry up.
Death's too good for you.

599
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:33,786
Why are you afraid of me?

600
01:01:34,087 --> 01:01:36,214
Because you look tense and cruel.

601
01:01:41,294 --> 01:01:42,921
Are you alone?

602
01:01:43,563 --> 01:01:47,226
Arthur's in the car.
He asked how much money there is.

603
01:01:47,434 --> 01:01:50,562
- I don't know.
- Didn't you count it?

604
01:01:51,004 --> 01:01:53,973
I'm scared. There's so much.

605
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:56,171
Too much to count fast.

606
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:59,470
- What denomination?
- All 10,000-franc notes.

607
01:02:04,284 --> 01:02:07,412
- We're doing it tonight.
- Not tonight. You can't.

608
01:02:09,522 --> 01:02:12,252
Especially after the coat business.
- What coat?

609
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:15,951
Madame Victoria's suspicious.
I forgot to put the coat back.

610
01:02:16,162 --> 01:02:17,527
It's nothing.

611
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:19,496
That's what you think.

612
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:23,630
How will you do it?

613
01:02:23,803 --> 01:02:27,398
You stand watch at the door.
It'll be over in two minutes.

614
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:29,871
It'll be child's play.

615
01:02:30,043 --> 01:02:33,240
It won't happen like that.
I know it won't.

616
01:02:36,783 --> 01:02:39,308
- But it will.
- That's what you say.

617
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:42,986
What happens when Mr. Stolz
finds the money gone?

618
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:47,523
Use your imagination.
You don't have to stay there.

619
01:02:49,629 --> 01:02:52,189
You told the old lady we met in class?

620
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:55,561
Too bad. She'll suspect me.

621
01:02:55,769 --> 01:02:58,795
I'll make something up, anything.

622
01:02:59,472 --> 01:03:01,838
That I saw prowlers outside.

623
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,272
So you do have imagination.

624
01:03:05,312 --> 01:03:07,075
That's true.

625
01:03:07,314 --> 01:03:09,612
I'll leave with you and Arthur.

626
01:03:11,885 --> 01:03:13,546
We have to split up.

627
01:03:13,787 --> 01:03:17,518
You can go with Arthur, if you want.
Or with me.

628
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:21,483
Where will you go?

629
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:26,455
To South America?

630
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:28,591
No, I'm going north.

631
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:30,670
ToJack London country.

632
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,031
He wrote some terrific books.

633
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:37,972
There's one about an Indian
who's a big liar, but really big!

634
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:41,508
He's such a liar
that the villagers, fed up, say:

635
01:03:42,015 --> 01:03:44,711
"Go. Come back
when you stop lying."

636
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:48,549
They send him off in a canoe
and he travels for two years.

637
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:52,751
He comes home and everybody asks
how his trip was.

638
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,961
He says: "Great, I saw these huge
machines rolling along going...

639
01:03:57,197 --> 01:03:59,791
There were others
that flew like this...

640
01:04:00,333 --> 01:04:02,858
And there were these great big houses."

641
01:04:03,103 --> 01:04:05,901
They all look at him and say:
"As big a liar as ever!"

642
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:09,807
So they send him off in a canoe again,
this time for good.

643
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,705
Odile looked away.

644
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,076
The wind ruffled her dark curls.

645
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:16,910
Franz was speechless.

646
01:04:17,016 --> 01:04:20,383
He stood there, sensing
something warm and scented.

647
01:04:20,553 --> 01:04:23,522
Then, feeling nothing was clear,
he looked up

648
01:04:23,723 --> 01:04:27,420
and saw her eyes speaking the words
they had exchanged.

649
01:04:28,762 --> 01:04:30,525
Where will you go?

650
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:33,524
If you come with me,
I'd go to South America.

651
01:04:33,733 --> 01:04:36,065
We could get an Italian boat in Nice.

652
01:04:36,669 --> 01:04:38,933
I don't know. I'll see.

653
01:04:39,439 --> 01:04:41,964
- I'd go if I were you.
- Why?

654
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:46,172
You won't stand up
to Mr. Stolz's questions.

655
01:04:46,413 --> 01:04:47,710
Sure I will.

656
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:50,577
- You'll get the seesaw.
- What's that?

657
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:54,514
They tie your arms and knees to a bar.

658
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:57,519
You're upside down
with your skirt over your head.

659
01:04:57,891 --> 01:05:00,485
After two or three days,
you'll give us away.

660
01:05:00,693 --> 01:05:02,593
I'll never give you away.

661
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:05,660
Neither of you. Never.

662
01:05:10,804 --> 01:05:13,534
I'll wait for you with Arthur.

663
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:16,607
I'll just fetch my bag.

664
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:52,437
At an embankment book stand,

665
01:05:52,545 --> 01:05:56,072
Franz bought the novel
which reminded him ofher.

666
01:05:56,282 --> 01:05:59,012
The Seine resembled a Corot.

667
01:05:59,185 --> 01:06:02,916
Odile asked what the big white
building was. The Louvre.

668
01:06:03,022 --> 01:06:05,684
She said it was smart
to paint it white,

669
01:06:05,892 --> 01:06:08,554
that the guy who did it
should be decorated.

670
01:06:19,472 --> 01:06:21,099
Listen to this.

671
01:06:30,817 --> 01:06:35,015
"Anglarès began to tell
a moving, stupid and somber tale.

672
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:38,987
A man enters a hotel
and asks for a room.

673
01:06:39,526 --> 01:06:41,255
He is given room 35.

674
01:06:41,494 --> 01:06:44,520
Coming down a few minutes later,
he tells the clerk:

675
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:47,600
'I have a bad memory,
so every time I come in,

676
01:06:48,034 --> 01:06:52,027
I'll tell you my name - Delouit -
and you say my room number.

677
01:06:52,405 --> 01:06:53,702
The clerk agrees.

678
01:06:53,806 --> 01:06:56,866
Shortly after, he returns
and says: 'Mr. Delouit.'

679
01:06:57,377 --> 01:06:58,969
'Room 35.'
'Thank you.'

680
01:06:59,178 --> 01:07:02,614
A moment later, a man,
extremely agitated,

681
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:07,015
covered in mud, his face bloodied
beyond recognition, stumbles in.

682
01:07:07,554 --> 01:07:10,955
'Mr. Delouit.'
'What? Mr. Delouit just went up.'

683
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:13,456
'Yes, but I fell out the window.

684
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,051
My room number, please?"'

685
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:23,995
Arthur said they'd wait till nightfall,

686
01:07:24,203 --> 01:07:27,366
in keeping with the tradition
ofbad B movies.

687
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:30,708
"How do we kill time?"Odile asked.

688
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:34,873
Franz had read of an American
who took 9 min. 45 sec.

689
01:07:34,981 --> 01:07:37,882
To visit the Louvre.
They decided to do better.

690
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:07,940
In 9 min. 43 sec.,
Arthur, Odile and Franz

691
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:11,380
broke the record set
byJimmyJohnson of San Francisco.

692
01:08:11,951 --> 01:08:15,785
The car, doing a steady 28 knots,
drove toward Joinville.

693
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:18,115
While Franz whistled lyrically,

694
01:08:18,324 --> 01:08:20,622
Odile gazed at Arthur tenderly.

695
01:08:20,827 --> 01:08:23,421
Henceforth, the three of them felt

696
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:25,895
that nothing could stop them now.

697
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,351
Under a crystal sky,
Arthur, Odile and Franz

698
01:08:56,629 --> 01:08:59,598
crossed bridges over impassive rivers.

699
01:09:00,299 --> 01:09:02,859
Nothing moved on the palace front.

700
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:06,461
The water was stagnant.
A taste of ashes floated in the air.

701
01:09:38,104 --> 01:09:39,935
What do I say about the bike?

702
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:43,302
That you fell and had to hitch home.

703
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:48,347
Your mind made up?

704
01:09:49,182 --> 01:09:52,481
I'll go the usual way.
You go around across the river.

705
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:54,846
Which door do we use?

706
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:56,886
The garage door, I said.

707
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:59,355
You have to be told everything twice.

708
01:10:04,931 --> 01:10:06,558
And afterwards?

709
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:08,826
Stay a bit to see what they do.

710
01:10:10,203 --> 01:10:12,296
Old man Stolz may call the cops.

711
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:14,769
They're not that old, you know.

712
01:10:14,874 --> 01:10:16,899
Then you can clear out, miss.

713
01:10:17,143 --> 01:10:18,735
You tired of me now?

714
01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:20,574
Of course not.

715
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:22,874
Where will I go?

716
01:10:23,716 --> 01:10:25,616
We'll find you a spot.

717
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:30,246
In an hour it'll all be over.
We'll be miles away.

718
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:33,520
Take off your stockings.
- What for?

719
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:36,056
Stop arguing.

720
01:10:36,162 --> 01:10:39,325
And don't frown like that.
It'll give you wrinkles.

721
01:10:46,405 --> 01:10:49,533
- If Madame Victoria...
- Lure her into the kitchen.

722
01:10:49,776 --> 01:10:52,540
Tell her you smell gas,
something like that.

723
01:10:52,845 --> 01:10:55,541
- She'll get scared.
- We have no choice.

724
01:10:55,648 --> 01:10:58,742
- You won't hurt her?
- No, we're not thugs.

725
01:10:58,951 --> 01:11:01,181
- Promise.
- Sure.

726
01:11:10,163 --> 01:11:13,564
I felt sorry for her
when she said "And afterwards?"

727
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,558
Why?

728
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:17,635
We're doing her a favor.

729
01:11:17,837 --> 01:11:20,431
Saving her from a lifetime of drudgery.

730
01:11:23,776 --> 01:11:25,243
Did you see?

731
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,743
Her thighs are so white.
- I saw.

732
01:11:29,348 --> 01:11:32,283
How come there are
no cop cars around?

733
01:11:32,385 --> 01:11:34,285
They must've spotted you.

734
01:11:34,387 --> 01:11:37,049
They're testing a new idiot detector.

735
01:12:06,152 --> 01:12:09,519
- She said you weren't lovers.
- I told you she's a liar.

736
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:31,567
- Where'd she go?
- I wonder. Stupid bitch!

737
01:13:45,418 --> 01:13:46,976
So there you are.

738
01:13:47,453 --> 01:13:49,318
- Don't make noise.
- She here?

739
01:13:49,522 --> 01:13:51,547
In the bathroom.

740
01:13:52,258 --> 01:13:54,556
- The window open?
- Why?

741
01:13:54,727 --> 01:13:56,752
Because I asked you.

742
01:13:58,597 --> 01:14:01,532
They say night air is good for the skin.

743
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:04,927
What about the dog?

744
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:08,733
I told him not to bark.
He won't be a problem.

745
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:17,573
Why are you holding your stomach?

746
01:14:20,152 --> 01:14:22,643
Because I kicked him.
He was scared.

747
01:14:24,357 --> 01:14:26,655
Upstairs, end of the hall.

748
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:32,029
I have to tell you something.

749
01:14:35,835 --> 01:14:37,427
You can tell us later.

750
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:43,264
Upstairs?

751
01:15:03,362 --> 01:15:05,796
What's with the door?
It won't open.

752
01:15:06,799 --> 01:15:08,767
- Is it locked?
- It can't be.

753
01:15:08,968 --> 01:15:10,560
It's never locked.

754
01:15:11,103 --> 01:15:12,798
I'll try it.

755
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:19,068
Maybe they lock it at night
without telling you.

756
01:15:19,545 --> 01:15:21,479
It can't be.

757
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:25,411
He must be suspicious.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

758
01:15:25,618 --> 01:15:27,449
No doubt about it, it's locked.

759
01:15:31,357 --> 01:15:33,120
And the window?

760
01:15:33,225 --> 01:15:35,455
We should've had a ladder ready.

761
01:15:40,766 --> 01:15:42,597
Go get one.

762
01:15:43,869 --> 01:15:45,803
There's one in the garage.

763
01:15:46,772 --> 01:15:51,209
I'll get the keys from the kitchen.
They're hanging on a nail.

764
01:17:55,201 --> 01:17:58,170
- Why not break the window?
- You can do it.

765
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:01,798
Idiot!
- Stop it!

766
01:18:01,907 --> 01:18:03,568
I'll teach you!

767
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,713
Hands off Odile from now on!

768
01:18:17,323 --> 01:18:19,450
- You okay?
- I'm okay!

769
01:18:30,069 --> 01:18:31,627
You mad at me?

770
01:18:31,804 --> 01:18:34,102
You didn't have to hit me.

771
01:18:34,306 --> 01:18:37,332
I'm as surprised as you
that the door was locked.

772
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:45,547
Why do you suppose it's locked...

773
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:51,281
if it never was before?

774
01:18:52,057 --> 01:18:53,854
Get off my back!

775
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:57,621
It's because of the coat.
I told you already.

776
01:18:58,897 --> 01:19:01,695
Yeah... Just our luck.

777
01:19:07,806 --> 01:19:09,865
Find the key by tomorrow.

778
01:19:12,978 --> 01:19:15,606
Please, it's too dangerous.

779
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:18,015
You'll find it.

780
01:19:18,684 --> 01:19:21,016
We'll be back tomorrow, same time.

781
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,855
It better be open.

782
01:19:48,847 --> 01:19:50,576
See you tomorrow.

783
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:00,490
Franz would have given a lot...

784
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:04,892
His gold watch, his American books,
his two hands, he didn't know exactly...

785
01:20:04,997 --> 01:20:07,591
But he would have given a lot
to console Odile.

786
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,824
One only had to look at her

787
01:20:10,002 --> 01:20:12,937
to realize the world
was crumbling around her.

788
01:21:03,021 --> 01:21:05,387
This is crazy. We'll be spotted.

789
01:21:05,691 --> 01:21:07,716
We'll say we're TV people.

790
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:09,794
TV is the open sesame.

791
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:23,539
So, got the key?

792
01:21:23,642 --> 01:21:26,236
- It's not 5:00 yet.
- We're in a hurry.

793
01:21:26,412 --> 01:21:28,903
Anyway, it's no good now.

794
01:21:29,114 --> 01:21:31,639
You left traces with the ladder.

795
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:35,508
When I came home,
all the locks were changed.

796
01:21:35,721 --> 01:21:39,054
Mr. Stolz's room,
the windows, the doors.

797
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:41,692
Did she say anything?

798
01:21:43,095 --> 01:21:45,256
She doesn't suspect me yet.

799
01:21:45,497 --> 01:21:47,727
Get out of here, please.

800
01:21:56,475 --> 01:21:58,102
Help!

801
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,905
Get out!
Odile, tell them to leave.

802
01:22:01,113 --> 01:22:02,876
I don't know what to do.

803
01:22:03,382 --> 01:22:05,543
Please don't hurt her.

804
01:22:05,851 --> 01:22:08,046
The key to Mr. Stolz's room.

805
01:22:08,253 --> 01:22:12,417
You're wasting your time.
He has nothing of value.

806
01:22:12,658 --> 01:22:14,683
We want to see for ourselves.

807
01:22:16,962 --> 01:22:18,793
Okay. The key.

808
01:22:20,098 --> 01:22:23,363
You can't scare me. It's not loaded.

809
01:22:35,113 --> 01:22:36,808
Tie her up.

810
01:22:37,015 --> 01:22:39,506
- With what?
- Where's your hair ribbon?

811
01:22:39,618 --> 01:22:40,915
No, Franz, no!

812
01:22:41,019 --> 01:22:43,419
I'm warning you, I mean business.

813
01:22:43,989 --> 01:22:45,581
Lie facedown.

814
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:48,883
Tie her arms in back.

815
01:22:48,994 --> 01:22:50,791
You know these men?

816
01:22:51,964 --> 01:22:53,864
I've never seen them before.

817
01:22:54,066 --> 01:22:55,863
Any cotton in the bathroom?

818
01:22:55,968 --> 01:22:57,731
I don't know.

819
01:22:57,836 --> 01:22:59,235
Go look.

820
01:22:59,338 --> 01:23:02,068
Not in my mouth. I won't scream.

821
01:23:02,241 --> 01:23:05,267
Please. I promise I won't make trouble.

822
01:23:05,444 --> 01:23:07,275
Shut the hell up, ma'am.

823
01:23:10,315 --> 01:23:13,648
Please forgive me, Madame Victoria.
Forgive me.

824
01:23:15,587 --> 01:23:17,987
I trusted you and you do this to me.

825
01:23:19,825 --> 01:23:21,656
Open the closet.

826
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,318
Open your mouth.

827
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:32,960
We'll hide her here.
Old man Stolz won't find her so fast.

828
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:35,502
Say she went out to see someone.

829
01:23:35,908 --> 01:23:38,138
Clear out first chance you get.

830
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,111
Stay here. I'm going up.

831
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,551
You're completely nuts!

832
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:04,693
Why don't you love me?

833
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:06,833
This is hardly the time.

834
01:24:13,612 --> 01:24:16,103
I want to hold you in my arms.

835
01:24:17,983 --> 01:24:20,008
What is it now?

836
01:24:36,935 --> 01:24:38,664
The money's gone.

837
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,540
This all? Where's the money?

838
01:24:43,742 --> 01:24:46,176
How should I know? I don't know.

839
01:24:46,712 --> 01:24:48,543
Let's search the place.

840
01:25:24,883 --> 01:25:26,510
This was in the garage.

841
01:25:26,618 --> 01:25:29,644
And this in the tub,
and this in Odile's room.

842
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:31,518
Where'd she go?

843
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:36,126
Check the fridge.
It's a housewife's safe.

844
01:25:38,697 --> 01:25:40,358
Where's the rest of it?

845
01:25:43,301 --> 01:25:44,859
I don't know.

846
01:25:45,037 --> 01:25:46,971
You were right. I found this.

847
01:25:48,306 --> 01:25:50,240
Was the pile this big?

848
01:25:50,642 --> 01:25:53,008
- No, bigger.
- This big?

849
01:25:55,147 --> 01:25:56,739
Yes, like that.

850
01:25:57,482 --> 01:25:59,347
That's enough. Let's go.

851
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:01,680
We'll make that goose talk.

852
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,549
Don't hurt her.
She'll have to tell us the truth.

853
01:26:06,124 --> 01:26:08,854
Just threaten her.
- Okay.

854
01:26:13,031 --> 01:26:16,262
Tell us where the money is
or we'll torch the house.

855
01:26:21,973 --> 01:26:23,531
She fainted.

856
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:32,343
She's not breathing.

857
01:26:33,852 --> 01:26:36,446
She's dead.
- You killed her!

858
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:41,122
We better beat it.

859
01:26:44,429 --> 01:26:46,590
Odile, darling! Let's go.

860
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:26,096
Arthur suddenly wanted to go back.

861
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:28,831
To make sure,
he said in an odd voice,

862
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,171
that the lady was really dead,
just to avoid any problems.

863
01:27:32,277 --> 01:27:34,643
They'd meet at the Tout Va Bien,

864
01:27:34,846 --> 01:27:37,007
a café just off the highway.

865
01:27:54,866 --> 01:27:57,562
Suddenly, Franz saw the uncle's car.

866
01:27:57,936 --> 01:28:00,496
Like the hero of a legendary romance,

867
01:28:00,872 --> 01:28:03,306
he suddenly had a dark foreboding.

868
01:28:03,508 --> 01:28:05,567
Despite Odile's pleadings,

869
01:28:05,677 --> 01:28:10,080
he did a U-turn and the car
obediently retraced its route.

870
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,847
Hey, asshole!

871
01:30:03,561 --> 01:30:07,292
Arthur's dying thought
was of Odile's face.

872
01:30:07,532 --> 01:30:10,262
As a dark fog descended on him,

873
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:13,132
he saw that fabled bird
of Indian legend,

874
01:30:13,338 --> 01:30:17,172
which is born without feet,
and thus can never alight.

875
01:30:17,575 --> 01:30:20,271
It sleeps in the high winds,

876
01:30:20,378 --> 01:30:22,744
and is only visible when it dies.

877
01:30:23,014 --> 01:30:24,948
When its transparent wings,

878
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:27,018
longer than an eagle's, fold in,

879
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:28,949
it fits in the palm of your hand.

880
01:31:47,565 --> 01:31:50,329
- You want to get us killed?
- Absolutely.

881
01:31:50,869 --> 01:31:52,393
What's got into you?

882
01:31:52,504 --> 01:31:54,062
I'm disgusted with life.

883
01:31:55,106 --> 01:31:57,097
We didn't make out so bad.

884
01:31:57,509 --> 01:31:59,602
Nothing to get dramatic about.

885
01:32:00,111 --> 01:32:01,874
But I feel terrible.

886
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,610
So do I.

887
01:32:08,186 --> 01:32:10,416
Why don't you close the hood?

888
01:32:10,889 --> 01:32:13,517
It doesn't close.

889
01:32:14,893 --> 01:32:17,521
Think Mr. Stolz will call the police?

890
01:32:18,063 --> 01:32:21,191
Not likely. It's money
he stole from the government.

891
01:32:22,267 --> 01:32:25,168
Isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

892
01:32:30,942 --> 01:32:34,901
Isn't it strange how people
never form a whole?

893
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,072
In what way?

894
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:41,648
They never come together.

895
01:32:42,387 --> 01:32:44,514
They remain separate.

896
01:32:45,323 --> 01:32:47,723
Each goes his own way,

897
01:32:48,726 --> 01:32:51,126
distrustful and tragic.

898
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:55,856
Even when they're together,
in big buildings,

899
01:32:56,568 --> 01:32:58,399
or in the street.

900
01:32:59,938 --> 01:33:01,872
Don't feel like talking?

901
01:33:07,145 --> 01:33:10,205
When I said I wanted
to hold you back there,

902
01:33:11,015 --> 01:33:12,812
were you listening?

903
01:33:12,917 --> 01:33:15,112
Yes, I was.

904
01:33:16,888 --> 01:33:18,947
But you're still sad?

905
01:33:21,326 --> 01:33:23,920
I'm not as sad as all that.

906
01:33:24,596 --> 01:33:26,928
Then what are you?

907
01:33:27,632 --> 01:33:30,533
I'm worn out from sorrow and fatigue.

908
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:34,233
What will you do then?

909
01:33:34,339 --> 01:33:35,806
And you?

910
01:33:36,841 --> 01:33:39,833
I can't decide between the north

911
01:33:40,478 --> 01:33:42,309
and the south.

912
01:33:43,781 --> 01:33:45,544
You decide.

913
01:33:45,717 --> 01:33:48,880
I... me... myself... us.

914
01:33:49,721 --> 01:33:52,781
I... you... yourself... you.

915
01:33:53,124 --> 01:33:56,685
His... their... your... our...

916
01:33:57,428 --> 01:33:58,986
their...

917
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:02,230
South.

918
01:34:11,309 --> 01:34:14,836
Three days later,
Odile and Franz saw the sea.

919
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:17,613
It looked like a theater,

920
01:34:17,715 --> 01:34:20,013
with the horizon as its stage,

921
01:34:20,185 --> 01:34:22,517
and beyond it nothing but sky.

922
01:34:22,754 --> 01:34:25,689
Before the gently spreading waves
of this harmony,

923
01:34:25,957 --> 01:34:29,586
Franz and Odile saw
neither limits nor contradictions.

924
01:34:31,129 --> 01:34:32,790
Are there lions in Brazil?

925
01:34:32,897 --> 01:34:35,764
As well as croc... Odiles.

926
01:34:36,134 --> 01:34:37,795
Thinking of me?

927
01:34:37,936 --> 01:34:39,665
Obviously.

928
01:34:39,771 --> 01:34:41,295
In what way?

929
01:34:41,906 --> 01:34:44,033
The way you think about me.

930
01:34:44,609 --> 01:34:46,406
When guys think of girls,

931
01:34:46,511 --> 01:34:49,742
they think about their eyes,
legs and breasts.

932
01:34:50,648 --> 01:34:53,412
Girls think of guys
in exactly the same way.

933
01:34:53,885 --> 01:34:55,648
So we're in love?

934
01:34:55,887 --> 01:34:57,718
We'll see soon enough.

935
01:35:03,728 --> 01:35:06,288
Put your hand around the ball.

936
01:35:07,699 --> 01:35:10,293
The liquid should flow across...

937
01:35:10,602 --> 01:35:12,502
if you love me.

938
01:35:15,873 --> 01:35:19,001
My story ends here,
like in a pulp novel,

939
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:21,704
at that superb moment
when nothing weakens,

940
01:35:21,946 --> 01:35:24,176
nothing wears away, nothing wanes.

941
01:35:24,582 --> 01:35:26,743
An upcoming film will reveal,

942
01:35:26,851 --> 01:35:29,115
in CinemaScope and Technicolor,

943
01:35:29,354 --> 01:35:32,084
the tropical adventures
of Odile and Franz.

944
01:35:33,305 --> 01:35:39,835
