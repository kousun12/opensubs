MY LIFE TO LIVE
A FILM IN TWELVE TABLEAUX

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:57,509
"Lend yourself to others,
but give yourself to yourself."
- Montaigne

A CAFE - NANA WANTS TO GIVE UP -
PAUL - THE PINBALL MACHINE

9
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,693
Do you really like the guy?

10
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,030
I don't know.

11
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,532
I wonder
what I was even thinking.

12
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,618
Does he have more money
than me?

13
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:27,748
What do you care?

14
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,964
Something bothering you?

15
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:40,135
No, I just wanted to deliver
that line a specific way.

16
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,931
I didn't know
the best way to say it.

17
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:48,143
Or I did know,
but I don't anymore.

18
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,981
Just when I should know, too.
Doesn't that ever happen to you?

19
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,401
Don't you ever talk
about anything but yourself?

20
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,737
You're horrible.

21
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,867
I'm not horrible, Nana.
I'm sad.

22
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,247
I'm not sad, Paul.
I'm horrible.

23
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,750
Don't talk nonsense.
This isn't a stage.

24
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:18,257
You never do as I ask, but you
always want me to do what you want.

25
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,760
Anyway, I'm fed up.
I want to die.

26
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,513
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

27
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,682
More nonsense.

28
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,187
It's exhausting loving you.
I always have to beg.

29
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,940
I exist too.

30
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,110
You say I'm cruel,
but you're the cruel one.

31
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:53,000
Why do you say that? It isn't true.
You mean Sunday evening?

32
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,544
You know very well when.

33
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,505
I begged you
to introduce me to that man.

34
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,966
You did it on purpose.

35
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,676
Yes, I did.

36
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,012
You're pathetic.

37
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:10,309
If we started over,
I'd just cheat on you again.

38
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:18,734
Don't say that.

39
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,152
It's true.

40
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:24,823
I thought it was important
we should meet, but I don't anymore.

41
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,660
We might have
got together again.

42
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,913
But the more we talk,
the less the words mean.

43
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:37,336
Anyway, if I make it on the stage,
it won't be thanks to you.

44
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,880
Acting isn't everything.

45
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,257
Not you too!
Why do you say that?

46
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,177
If it's what I want,
why should you mind?

47
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,013
I might be discovered
someday.

48
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes, you mustn't give up.

49
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,028
I haven't given up music.

50
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,990
Not like your English lessons.
You were never really interested.

51
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,034
I'm not giving up.

52
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,870
In fact, that guy's going
to take pictures of me.

53
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,082
Maybe I'll get into the movies.

54
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,501
That'll be the day.

55
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:30,722
You're horrible, Paul.

56
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,310
You really are.
It's always the same.

57
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:40,690
You say you love me,
but you don't consider me special.

58
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:46,905
I hardly love you anymore,
but I still consider you special.

59
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:51,535
Why do you say things like that?
I think we're all the same.

60
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,247
You don't approve of me
looking for work?

61
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,959
It suits you even less
than all the rest.

62
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,421
Anyway, you're leaving me
because I'm poor.

63
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,048
When all's said and done, maybe.

64
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,219
Have you got the pictures
you mentioned on the phone?

65
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,808
I forgot them. They'll be ready
at the end of the week.

66
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,979
Is he all right?
Is he eating well?

67
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,524
He had an earache,
but the doctor said it was nothing.

68
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,152
What's your job at Pathe-Marconi?

69
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,279
I sell records.

70
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,241
Can you lend me 2,000 francs?

71
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,952
Out of the question.

72
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:39,166
Your parents
must be glad I'm gone.

73
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,917
No, they liked you.

74
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,669
I'll bet.

75
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:54,222
What's that look for?

76
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,057
Nothing.

77
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,686
Let's not start quarreling again.

78
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,814
How about a game?

79
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,483
Sure.

80
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,198
Got a coin?
I only have one.

81
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,991
Yes, I do.

82
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,097
You go first.

83
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,956
I'm suddenly thinking of those essays
my dad's students write.

84
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,541
What about them?

85
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,711
He read us some great ones
last night over dinner.

86
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:11,341
They're just kids. They had
to describe their favorite animals.

87
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,844
One little girl of eight
chose a bird.

88
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,722
How did it go?

89
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,017
"A bird is an animal
with an inside and an outside.

90
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,520
Take away the outside
and the inside is left.

91
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,274
Take away the inside
and you see its soul."

92
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:45,125
THE RECORD SHOP - 2,000 FRANCS -
NANA LIVES HER LIFE

93
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,595
No, we're out of that, sir.

94
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,893
What about Judy Garland?

95
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,939
We don't have her either.

96
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,614
Do you have a guitar recording
by Romeo -

97
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,492
What's his name?
Rafael Romero.

98
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,537
I'll ask.

99
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,043
Rafael Romero on guitar.

100
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,545
In the bins in back.

101
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,698
Is Rita still sick?

102
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,493
Yes. I think she'll be back
Thursday.

103
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,995
What a drag.
She owes me 2,000 francs.

104
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,961
- Can you lend me 2,000?
- You crazy? I'm broke.

105
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,091
Why? Anything wrong?
- No, nothing.

106
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,676
Here it is.

107
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,387
I'll take this too.

108
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,408
This way, sir.

109
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,034
That looks great.

110
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,955
The story's stupid,
but it's very well written.

111
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,460
"He gazed at the turquoise,
star-laden sky

112
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,587
and then turned to me.

113
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,048
'You live your life intensely,
so logically -'

114
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,717
I interrupted him.

115
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,928
'You attach
too much importance to logic.'

116
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:49,142
For a few seconds I was filled
with a bitter sense of triumph.

117
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,937
No more broken heart,
no more struggle to live again.

118
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,983
No probing questions to face
while masking one's defeat.

119
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,862
Yes, a truly elegant way
of breaking this deadlock."

120

THE CONCIERGE - PAUL -

121
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,419
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC -
A JOURNALIST

122
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,572
Please give me my key.

123
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,700
All right, then.

124
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,998
Arthur! Get her!

125
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,380
Come on, give me the key.

126
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,679
Here, honey.

127
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,685
Hi.

128
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,104
Where are you headed?

129
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,273
Want to see the pictures?

130
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,535
He doesn't look like me at all.
He looks more like you.

131
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,037
Come have dinner?

132
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,584
- Where are you going?
- Boulevard Saint-Michel.

133
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,336
- Come have dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

134
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,172
I want to see a movie.
Bye.

135
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,262
JOAN OF ARC

136
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,713
We have come
to prepare you for death!

137
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,437
Now... already?

138
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,282
How am I to die?

139
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,830
At the stake!

140
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,974
How can you still believe
you were sent by God?

141
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:26,693
God knows our path, but we understand it
only at the end of the road!

142
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,039
Yes, I am his child!

143
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,010
And the great victory?

144
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,561
It will be my martyrdom!

145
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,855
And your deliverance?

146
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,366
Death!

147
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,258
Death.

148
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,478
I said good-bye already.

149
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,438
I paid for your movie ticket.

150
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,273
Too bad.

151
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,743
Evening. How are you?

152
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,578
Evening. How are things?

153
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,831
- Didn't we have a date tonight?
- Yes.

154
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,668
I wondered if you were coming.
- Why? Am I late?

155
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:11,589
Just a bit.
But that's not why I wondered.

156
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,759
I'm usually very punctual.

157
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,638
11:00 p.m. is very late.

158
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,895
I thought you'd forgotten too.

159
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,648
What will you have?

160
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,317
- Any rolls left?
- Sorry, no.

161
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,277
A coffee, then.

162
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,741
Was that a friend outside?

163
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,119
No, it was my brother.

164
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,871
You have lots
of brothers and sisters?

165
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,916
Five brothers and three sisters.

166
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,253
Surprised? It's true.

167
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,299
What's new since Wednesday?

168
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,010
Nothing much.

169
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,722
Is that red car outside yours?

170
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,809
What is it? A Jaguar?

171
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,480
No, an Alfa Romeo.
Are you interested in cars?

172
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,817
No, I don't know
a thing about them.

173
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,822
When shall we take
those pictures?

174
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,993
You tell me.
I already told you I'm ready.

175
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,745
But I'm only free on Sundays.

176
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,624
I'm off to London on Sunday.

177
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,043
Well then, I don't know.

178
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,841
How about now?
Are you tired?

179
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,387
If I say no,
you won't think I'm awful?

180
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,598
Not at all.

181
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,603
Do you really think
I could get into films?

182
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,229
I think so.

183
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,524
Look, I brought you
a composite sheet.

184
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,786
I'd like to do
something like that.

185
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,207
What's this for?

186
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,919
You send it out
to people in films,

187
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,881
and a few days later
maybe they call you.

188
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,844
I'm a bit shy
about undressing.

189
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,597
Just a little.
What can it hurt?

190
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,602
Could you lend me 2,000 francs?

191
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,063
I would, but I haven't got it.

192
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,524
I'm tired.

193
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,531
What about my pictures?

194
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,534
You'll come with me then?

195
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:08,933
THE POLICE -
NANA IS QUESTIONED

196
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,356
Nana Klein-what?

197
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:21,320
K-L-E-I-N...

198
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:28,494
F-R-A-N-K-E-N...

199
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,622
H-E-I-M.

200
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:38,337
Born April 15th, 1940,
at Flexburg, Moselle.

201
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,215
No fixed address.
Is that right?

202
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,134
Yes.

203
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,803
All right. What happened?

204
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,974
Well, I was walking
down the street,

205
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,060
and I saw a woman
buying a magazine.

206
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:58,566
Then... she took some money
out of her bag.

207
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,987
She didn't notice
she'd dropped 1,000 francs.

208
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:09,660
So then... I pretended
to buy a magazine too,

209
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,497
and I put my foot
on her 1,000 francs.

210
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,336
She left and -

211
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,219
And she realized it?

212
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,524
She walked back toward me...

213
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,362
and stared into my eyes
for a long time.

214
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,409
So I gave her back her money.

215
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,379
Then why did she bring charges?

216
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,674
I don't know.
I think it was very mean of her.

217
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,311
Don't you have anyone
you can stay with in Paris?

218
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,439
Friends, sometimes.

219
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,275
Boys?

220
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,030
Sometimes.

221
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,703
Why not ask
for an advance at work?

222
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,416
I already have, too many times.

223
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,379
What are you going to do?

224
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,381
I don't know.

225
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,299
I...

226
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,845
I... is someone else.

227
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:02,940
THE BOULEVARDS -
THE FIRST MAN - THE ROOM

228
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,716
How about it?

229
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,480
Is this the place?

230
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,233
You've been here before?

231
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,902
Yes, it is.

232
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,586
Anyone there?

233
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,880
You want Room 27 or 28?

234
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,551
Room 27.

235
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,461
- Do you smoke?
- No, thanks.

236
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,926
There's never an ashtray.

237
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,722
Here's one.

238
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,861
How much do you want?

239
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,157
I don't know.
It's up to you.

240
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,870
I don't know.

241
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,998
Four thousand francs?

242
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,851
You owe me 1,000.

243
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,812
I have no change.

244
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,440
Keep it.
It doesn't matter.

245
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,568
It's true.
I'm not just trying to get more.

246
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,738
But you have
to take everything off.

247
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,749
Why not on the mouth?

248
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:44,596
MEETING YVETTE -
A CAFE IN THE SUBURBS -

249
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,225
RAOUL -
GUNSHOTS IN THE STREET

250
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,493
Yvette! How are you?

251
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,496
Is that you? You cut your hair!
- A long time ago.

252
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,081
- How are you?
- And you?

253
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,542
- Oh, I'm getting by.
- Me too.

254
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,752
Good for you.

255
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,671
- Why?
- I thought that -

256
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:21,175
What are you doing here?

257
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,385
I'm thirsty.
Shall we get a drink?

258
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,012
I'd love to.

259
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,056
How's Raymond?

260
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,768
Oh, I'll tell you all about it.

261
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,228
What happened?

262
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,190
Life is cruel.

263
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:41,445
I'd like to get away,
escape to the tropics.

264
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,281
- Escape is a pipe dream.
- Why?

265
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,366
It just is.

266
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,245
This is it.

267
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,086
Shall we sit over there?

268
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,640
I'll be back in a minute.

269
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,493
So tell me.

270
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,204
One evening, Raymond...

271
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,335
came home
with train tickets to Brest.

272
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,172
He said he had a job,
so we took the kids and moved

273
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:46,093
and went to live
in a hotel by the harbor.

274
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,722
He'd disappear
for the entire day.

275
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,183
He was "working."

276
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:57,187
I'd take the children out,
buy them ice cream.

277
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,983
I was worried,

278
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,695
because I couldn't figure out
how he earned his money.

279
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:09,283
One evening,
after three weeks of that,

280
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,619
he just never came back.

281
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,706
I had to manage on my own...

282
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,918
with the children that
my mother-in-law wouldn't look after

283
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,212
because she didn't like me.

284
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:27,885
I gradually became a prostitute.
It was the easiest way.

285
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:36,101
Then, two years later,
I went to the movies one night...

286
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,481
and saw him acting
in an American movie.

287
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,651
And things are fine now?

288
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,403
Everything's fine.

289
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,238
What would you like?

290
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,699
- White wine.
- Rose.

291
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,078
Still, it doesn't sound
like much fun.

292
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,540
No, it's depressing,
but it's not my fault.

293
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,423
I think we're always responsible
for our actions. We're free.

294
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,177
I raise my hand -
I'm responsible.

295
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,973
I turn my head to the right -
I'm responsible.

296
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:20,312
I'm unhappy -
I'm responsible.

297
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,942
I smoke a cigarette -
I'm responsible.

298
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,030
I shut my eyes -
I'm responsible.

299
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,243
I forget that I'm responsible,
but I am.

300
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,915
I told you
escape is a pipe dream.

301
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,126
After all,
everything is beautiful.

302
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,089
You only have to take an interest
in things, see their beauty.

303
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,677
It's true.

304
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,972
After all,
things are just what they are.

305
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,141
A face is a face.

306
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,978
Plates are plates.

307
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,146
Men are men.

308
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,067
And life... is life.

309
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,536
The guy I said hello to by the door
wants to meet you.

310
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,912
Would you mind?

311
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,580
Not at all.

312
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,018
My girl's not the kind
to be seen

313
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,395
In a chic magazine

314
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,439
That's plain to see

315
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,233
No starlet's
sunglasses or gowns

316
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,610
She works across town

317
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,529
In a factory

318
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,365
Some plain furnished rooms
are our home

319
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,617
We live there alone

320
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,745
She and I

321
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,581
A warehouse
and rooftops below

322
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,292
From our little window

323
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,335
Meet the eye

324
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,963
Vacations we spend
close at hand

325
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,424
The Riviera's too grand

326
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,217
For our pay

327
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,054
Loved ones are distant and few

328
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,639
I've a godmother who

329
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,142
Lives far away

330
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,561
But my girl, though just 25

331
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,980
Is the sweetest that I've

332
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,066
Ever seen

333
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,818
No saint in any church
you could find

334
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,279
Is as sweet or as kind

335
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,198
At least to me

336
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,284
When the town dozes off
in the blaze

337
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,745
Of the sun's summer rays

338
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,705
Burning bright

339
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,416
With my baby girl
wrapped in my arms

340
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,002
I drink in her charms

341
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,879
And hold her tight

342
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,673
We whisper our thoughts, she and I

343
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,343
As light fades from the sky

344
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,261
Up above

345
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,931
In the secrecy of our four walls

346
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,475
As night slowly falls

347
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,060
We make love

348
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,362
Is she a lady or a tramp?

349
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,909
Insult her. If she's a tramp,
she'll get angry.

350
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,120
If she smiles, she's a lady.

351
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,788
Raoul.

352
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,963
A hot toddy.

353
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,844
We'll find out.

354
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,479
You're a friend of Yvette's?

355
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,481
That's right.

356
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,651
I know you very well.

357
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,529
- You're lying.
- I saw you three months ago.

358
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,864
You're lying.

359
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,160
A guy was showing you pictures
on Boulevard Saint-Germain.

360
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,828
That's true.

361
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:09,332
Then why did you deny it?
You say any old nonsense.

362
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,169
You're pathetic.

363
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,547
Why do you look at me like that?

364
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,509
You look stupid,
and your hair looks awful.

365
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,185
Wait here.
I need to talk to you.

366
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,228
You okay?

367
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,896
My eyes!

368
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:28,203
THE LETTER - RAOUL AGAIN -
THE CHAMPS-ELYSEES

369
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:13,915
Dear Madame, a friend who worked
for you gave me your address.

370
00:38:53,664 --> 00:39:00,503
I would like to come
and work for you.

371
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:16,853
I am 22 years old.

372
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:37,540
I think I am pretty.

373
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:49,386
My height is...

374
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:14,369
5'6".

375
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:30,969
I have short hair...

376
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:59,122
but it grows very quickly.

377
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:20,477
Enclosed is a picture and...

378
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,191
Oh, it's you.

379
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,278
The classic letter.

380
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,157
Yes, it's me.

381
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,661
How did you know I was here?

382
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,455
I followed you.

383
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,959
I was in my car,
and I saw you come in here.

384
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,338
You've got some nerve.

385
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,216
No, you're very beautiful.

386
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,061
You really skipped out quickly
the other day.

387
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,771
When?

388
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,690
When that crook was shot
outside the cafe.

389
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,151
You just vanished.

390
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,783
I don't think they were crooks.
It was some political stuff.

391
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,537
Really? I didn't know.

392
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,832
In any case,
I didn't mean you aren't brave.

393
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,044
I was just making conversation.

394
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,559
What do you think of me?

395
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,227
Me?

396
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,895
Yes, you.

397
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,525
I think there's
a lot of goodness inside you.

398
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,860
What? A lot of what?

399
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:57,323
There's a lot of goodness
in your eyes.

400
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,411
Really?
I didn't understand.

401
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,038
Anyway,
that's an odd thing to say.

402
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,748
Why?

403
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:19,345
I wasn't expecting a Catholic response.
What I meant was:

404
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,765
Do you place me
in a special category of women?

405
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,276
You like being special?

406
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,155
Why?

407
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,824
No reason.

408
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,453
For me, there are
three types of girls:

409
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:51,044
those with one expression,
those with two, and those with three.

410
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,553
Did Yvette give you this address?

411
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,479
Are you really serious about it?

412
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,147
Why?

413
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,984
I'd like to earn more money.

414
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,821
I can help you earn
even more here in Paris.

415
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,658
Really? Fine with me.

416
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,174
Why not try to get into movies?
You're a pretty girl.

417
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,426
I did try.

418
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,763
Two years ago,
I wanted to make it on the stage.

419
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,517
I was in Pacifico
at the Chatelet.

420
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,562
And I was in a film once
with Eddie Constantine.

421
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:56,025
I'm telling you my life story.
How awful.

422
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,698
No, it's not. I'm a friend.

423
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,201
Give me a smile.

424
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,704
No, I don't feel like it.

425
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,911
Shall I come with you?

426
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,715
When do I start?

427
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:06,137
"When the city lights go on, the
streetwalkers' desperate rounds begin."

428
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:19,942
AFTERNOONS - MONEY - SINKS -
PLEASURE - HOTELS

429
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,280
What exactly do I do?

430
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:28,159
The prostitute earns all she can
by trading on her charms

431
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,497
to build up a good clientele and
establish the best working conditions.

432
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,376
Does she have
to be beautiful?

433
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:42,423
No, although beauty is an important
factor in a prostitute's career.

434
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:47,845
It establishes her place in the hierarchy
and attracts the attention of the pimp,

435
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:52,308
since her physical allure can be
a source of great profit.

436
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,520
Does she have
to register somewhere?

437
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,898
Before the law
of April 13th, 1946,

438
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,776
prostitutes were subject to medical
and police surveillance.

439
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,904
Under the new law,
only medical surveillance

440
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,823
is now required.

441
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,245
The 1946 law and Decree 2253
of November 5th, 1947,

442
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:17,166
established the National Sanitary
Register for all women

443
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,294
shown by conclusive evidence

444
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,798
to be engaged in prostitution.

445
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,009
But what do I do?

446
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:31,013
Regardless of the neighborhood,
the procedure is the same.

447
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,100
By her dress,
attitude, and makeup,

448
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,769
the prostitute indicates
her trade.

449
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,938
Sometimes,
in defiance of the law,

450
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:43,192
she gestures to the client
or propositions him outright.

451
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,362
What do I charge?

452
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,990
It can vary greatly,

453
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,158
from 300 to 15,000 francs

454
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:54,203
for an encounter lasting
from a few minutes to an hour

455
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,080
called a "trick."

456
00:47:56,248 --> 00:48:00,209
An "overnight" ranges
from 5,000 to 50,000 francs.

457
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,337
Can I go anywhere I like?

458
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:07,216
Controls have been attempted.
In Paris, for instance

459
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,177
a police regulation
of August 25th, 1958,

460
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:15,266
forbids loitering
with intent to solicit

461
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:19,186
during certain hours
in the Bois de Boulogne

462
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,397
and around the Champs-Elysees.

463
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,774
Do I keep a percentage?

464
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,237
A daily "quota"
is agreed upon in advance.

465
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,073
Around the Champs-Elysees
and the Madeleine,

466
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,242
it's 20,000
to 30,000 francs a day,

467
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,620
paid at the end of the week.

468
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,289
Do I have my own room?

469
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:43,210
Usually only the towels are changed
between tricks, not the sheets.

470
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,881
Some hotels provide no blankets,
only a bottom sheet.

471
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,592
What about the police?

472
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,887
They conduct raids
and interrogations.

473
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,182
Any woman in violation
of regulations

474
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,852
can be detained in a clinic
as long as necessary

475
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,896
for extensive testing.

476
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,858
Can I have a drink
in a cafe?

477
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,236
A prostitute who drinks heavily
earns very little.

478
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,782
She's undesirable
because she creates a scene.

479
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,119
What if I get pregnant?

480
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:20,790
One might think a prostitute
would seek an abortion at any cost.

481
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,750
That's not the case.

482
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:29,924
They do try to avoid pregnancy,
by chemical means or any other.

483
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,803
But once pregnancy is confirmed,
abortions are rare.

484
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,306
Must I accept anyone?

485
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:42,979
The prostitute must always be
at the client's disposal.

486
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,648
She must accept anyone
who pays.

487
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,441
That man...

488
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,152
that man...

489
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,993
Are there clients every day?

490
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,954
Lower-grade prostitutes

491
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,165
average
five to eight clients a day,

492
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,043
earning 4,000 to 8,000 a day.

493
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:09,505
However, some manage
exceptional turnover.

494
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:14,176
Sixty clients is not unheard of
on Saturdays or holidays.

495
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:21,684
A YOUNG MAN - LUIGI - NANA
WONDERS WHETHER SHE'S HAPPY

496
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,769
Do I get days off?

497
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,148
Usually after the medical check.

498
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:31,235
Her man usually takes her out,

499
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:34,447
often to see her child
in the country.

500
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,533
Afterwards, they go out
to a restaurant or a movie.

501
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,956
- Is Luigi here?
- Upstairs.

502
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,377
I'll be five minutes.

503
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,880
The movie already started anyway.

504
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,009
A white wine.

505
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,607
Got any Gauloises?

506
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,920
- You have cigarettes?
- Yes. What kind?

507
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,089
I was just wondering.

508
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,391
- Got any cigarettes?
- They've got some downstairs.

509
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,318
- How are you?
- So-so.

510
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,487
What's wrong with her?

511
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,823
We were supposed
to see a movie.

512
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,825
I'll cheer you up.

513
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,713
I'll do the kid
blowing up a balloon.

514
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,517
He's got a balloon,
and he blows it up.

515
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,314
You ought to be my man.

516
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,942
Happy now?
Will you let us talk?

517
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:40,831
THE STREETS - A GUY -
HAPPINESS IS NO FUN

518
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,083
Did you see Inspector Fleytoux?
He bought a BMW.

519
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,785
They could have provided chairs.

520
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,037
It's always like that.

521
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,754
How much?

522
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,674
3,000.
5,000 if I undress.

523
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:19,513
Can't you give me one more?
- I have to keep some.

524
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,558
- One of these, then?
- It's all I've got.

525
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,644
A little one.
It would be so nice.

526
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:30,524
You come here often?

527
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,112
But I've seen you before,
haven't I?

528
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,822
Maybe.

529
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,035
What's your name?

530
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,829
Dimitri.

531
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,707
Nice name.

532
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,461
Yes, I'm fond of it.

533
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,089
What line of work are you in?

534
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,092
I shoot pictures for ads.

535
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,136
You mean like in the movies?

536
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,263
No, still pictures.

537
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,058
I was in a movie with
Eddie Constantine two months ago.

538
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,145
No Pity.
Did you see it?

539
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:16,445
You don't say much.
Are you the romantic type?

540
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:25,287
If you give me more,
you can stay.

541
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,878
That's what you want?

542
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,714
I'll go see.

543
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,599
Never mind.

544
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,652
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

545
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:02,491
- Can you spare five minutes?
- Ask Monique. She's in 41.

546
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,798
- What's up?
- Nothing.

547
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,011
The elevators never work.

548
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,015
See you Tuesday
at the Olympia.

549
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,824
- What are you doing?
- Going downstairs.

550
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,868
- Can you spare a moment?
- How much?

551
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,663
I don't know.
We can discuss it.

552
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,331
All right.

553
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,500
Room 45.

554
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,190
Work it out with her.

555
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,158
- All right?
- Yes.

556
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,667
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth. Like the Queen of England.

557
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,881
Shall I strip too?

558
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,799
Actually, don't bother.

559
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,218
So you don't need me anymore?

560
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,345
I don't know.

561
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,273
Like that.

562
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:19,294
PLACE DU CHATELET - A STRANGER -
NANA, THE UNWITTING PHILOSOPHER

563
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,368
Do you mind me looking?

564
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,540
You look bored.

565
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,166
Not at all.

566
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,171
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

567
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,808
Will you buy me a drink?

568
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,269
If you like.

569
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,986
Do you come here often?

570
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,156
Occasionally.
Today I just happened by.

571
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,993
Why are you reading?

572
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,828
It's my job.

573
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,920
It's funny.

574
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,088
Suddenly I don't know what to say.

575
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,008
It happens to me a lot.

576
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,510
I know what I want to say.

577
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:36,890
I think first about whether
they're the right words.

578
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:42,228
But when the moment comes
to speak, I can't say it.

579
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,773
Yes, of course.

580
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:47,776
Have you read
The Three Musketeers?

581
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,196
No, but I saw the movie. Why?

582
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:57,285
Because in it, Porthos -

583
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,498
Actually, this is from
Twenty Years Later.

584
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,585
Porthos is tall, strong,
and a little dense.

585
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,589
He's never had a thought in his life.

586
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:15,804
He has to place a bomb
in a cellar to blow it up.

587
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,889
He does it.

588
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:22,477
He places the bomb, lights the fuse,
and starts to run away.

589
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:26,106
But just then he begins to think.

590
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,234
About what?

591
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:33,488
How it's possible to put
one foot in front of the other.

592
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,324
I'm sure that's happened to you.

593
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:42,414
So he stops running.
He can't move forward.

594
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,170
The bomb explodes,
and the cellar caves in around him.

595
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,507
He holds it up
with his strong shoulders.

596
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:57,429
But after a day or two,
he's crushed to death.

597
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,598
So the first time he thought,
it killed him.

598
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,476
Why do you tell me
things like that?

599
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:07,230
No reason. Just to talk.

600
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,899
Why must one always talk?

601
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:14,779
I think one should often
just keep quiet, live in silence.

602
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:19,409
The more one talks,
the less the words mean.

603
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,704
Perhaps,
but can one do that?

604
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:25,373
I don't know.

605
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,294
It's always struck me,
the fact we can't live without speaking.

606
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,801
But it would be nice.

607
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,722
Yes, it would be nice, wouldn't it?

608
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,434
Sort of like we loved
one another more.

609
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:47,729
But it's impossible.
No one's been able to.

610
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,397
But why?

611
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,734
Words should express
just what one wants to say.

612
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,070
Do they betray us?

613
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,074
Yes, but we betray them too.

614
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,409
One should be able
to express oneself.

615
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,953
We manage
to write things quite well.

616
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:07,999
It's extraordinary
that someone like Plato

617
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:12,087
can still be understood.
People really do understand him.

618
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:16,132
Yet he wrote in Greek
2,500 years ago.

619
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:21,471
No one really knows
the language, not exactly.

620
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:26,184
Yet something gets through, so we
should be able to express ourselves.

621
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:29,771
And we have to.

622
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,942
Why do we have to?
To understand each other?

623
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,615
We must think,

624
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,743
and for thought we need words.

625
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,121
There's no other way to think.

626
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,749
To communicate, one must speak.
That's our life.

627
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,502
Yes, but at the same time,
it's very hard.

628
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,634
Whereas I think
life should be easy.

629
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:07,809
Your tale about the Three Musketeers
may be a very nice story,

630
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:09,853
but it's terrible.

631
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,772
Yes, but it's a pointer.

632
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:15,817
I believe

633
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:22,323
one learns to speak well only when
one has renounced life for a while.

634
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,493
That's the price.
- So to speak is fatal?

635
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:29,998
Speaking is almost
a resurrection in relation to life.

636
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,335
Speaking is a different life
from when one does not speak.

637
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,797
So to live speaking,

638
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,968
one must pass through
the death of life without speaking.

639
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:44,971
I don't know if I'm being clear...

640
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:51,186
but there's a kind of ascetic rule
that stops one from speaking well

641
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:55,023
until one sees life with detachment.

642
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:03,114
But one can't live everyday life
with... I don't know -

643
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,909
Detachment?

644
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:10,663
We go back and forth. That's why
we pass from silence to words.

645
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:16,211
We swing between the two,
because it's the movement of life.

646
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:20,715
From everyday life
one rises to a life -

647
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:25,428
Let's call it superior - why not?
It's the thinking life.

648
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:29,515
But the thinking life presupposes
that one has killed off

649
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:32,810
a life that's too mundane,
too rudimentary.

650
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:38,441
Then thinking and speaking
are the same thing?

651
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,526
I believe so.

652
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:44,280
It's in Plato, you know.
It's an old idea.

653
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:48,243
I don't think
one can distinguish a thought

654
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,870
from the words that express it.

655
01:10:50,996 --> 01:10:57,085
A moment of thought can only
be grasped through words.

656
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:59,879
So to speak is to risk lying?

657
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,966
Lies too are part of our quest.

658
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:06,427
There's little difference
between an error and a lie.

659
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:11,182
I don't mean ordinary lies,
like promising,

660
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:15,770
"I'll be here tomorrow at 5:00,"
and then not showing up.

661
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,981
Those are just ploys.

662
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:24,487
But a subtle lie
often differs little from an error.

663
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:28,616
One's searching for something
and can't find the right word.

664
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:33,079
That's why you didn't know
what to say before.

665
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:37,125
I think you were afraid
of not finding the right word.

666
01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:43,381
How can one be sure
of having found the right word?

667
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:49,554
One must work at it.
It only comes with effort.

668
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:54,267
To say what must be said
in the appropriate way,

669
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,519
that is, that doesn't hurt,

670
01:11:56,645 --> 01:12:00,106
that says what must be said,
does what must be done,

671
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,775
without hurting
or wounding anyone.

672
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,613
One must try to act in good faith.

673
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:10,992
Someone once told me,

674
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,996
"There's truth in everything,
even in error."

675
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,248
It's true.

676
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:21,336
That's what France didn't see
in the 17th century.

677
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:26,132
They thought one could
avoid errors and lies,

678
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,469
that one could live
directly in the truth.

679
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,346
I don't think it's possible.

680
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:34,640
Hence Kant, Hegel,
German philosophy:

681
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:37,602
to bring us back to life

682
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:42,982
and make us see that we must pass
through error to arrive at truth.

683
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,863
What do you think about love?

684
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:55,244
The body had to come into it,

685
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:58,164
and indeed,
Leibniz introduced the contingent.

686
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:02,710
Contingent truths
and necessary truths make up life.

687
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:06,881
German philosophy
showed us that in life,

688
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:11,094
one thinks with the constraints
and errors of life.

689
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:14,555
One must manage with that.
It's true.

690
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:20,311
Shouldn't love be the only truth?

691
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:26,025
But for that,
love would always have to be true.

692
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:30,238
Do you know anyone who knows
right off what he loves?

693
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:34,325
No. When you're 20,
you don't know.

694
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,579
All you know are bits and pieces.
You grasp at experience.

695
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:42,333
At that age, "I love"
is a mixture of many things.

696
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:48,548
To be completely at one
with what you love takes maturity.

697
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:50,883
That means searching.

698
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,136
That's the truth of life.

699
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,265
That's why love is a solution,

700
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,643
but on the condition that it be true.

701
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:10,319
THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN - THE OVAL
PORTRAIT - RAOUL TRADES NANA

702
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,290
What shall we do today?

703
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,375
I don't know.

704
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,794
Shall we go
to the Luxembourg Garden?

705
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,467
I think it's going to rain.

706
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:38,764
"I thus saw in vivid light
a picture all unnoticed before.

707
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:43,936
It was the portrait of a young girl
just ripening into womanhood.

708
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:48,608
I glanced at the painting hurriedly,
and then closed my eyes.

709
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:01,370
It was an impulsive movement
to gain time for thought,

710
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,208
to make sure that my vision
had not deceived me,

711
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:10,338
to calm and subdue my fancy
for a more sober and more certain gaze.

712
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:15,510
In a very few moments
I again looked fixedly at the painting.

713
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:25,937
The portrait, I have already said,
was that of a young girl.

714
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:29,941
It was a mere head and shoulders,

715
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:34,237
done in what is technically
termed a vignette manner,

716
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:38,699
much in the style
of the favorite heads of Sully.

717
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:43,204
The arms, the bosom,
and even the ends of the radiant hair

718
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:47,458
melted imperceptibly
into the vague yet deep shadow

719
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:49,919
which formed
the background of the whole.

720
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:54,173
As a thing of art,
nothing could be more admirable

721
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,592
than the painting itself.

722
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:00,638
But it could have been
neither the execution of the work,

723
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,890
nor the immortal beauty
of the countenance,

724
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:06,519
which had so suddenly
and so vehemently moved me.

725
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:11,065
Least of all could it have been that
my fancy, shaken from its half slumber,

726
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,360
had mistaken the head
for that of a living person.

727
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,326
At length, satisfied
with the true secret of its effect,

728
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:25,079
I fell back within the bed.

729
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,082
I had found the spell of the picture

730
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:33,421
in an absolute life-likeliness
of expression."

731
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,464
Is that your book?

732
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:37,633
No, I found it here.

733
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:45,641
Can I have one?

734
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:59,363
It's our story:
a painter portraying his love.

735
01:17:00,073 --> 01:17:01,741
Shall I go on?

736
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:08,998
"And in sooth
some who beheld the portrait

737
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:12,960
spoke of its resemblance
in low words as of a mighty marvel,

738
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,297
and a proof not less
of the power of the painter

739
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:20,968
than of his deep love for her
whom he depicted so surpassingly well.

740
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:25,473
But at length, as the labor drew
nearer to its conclusion,

741
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,142
there were admitted none
into the turret.

742
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,395
For the painter had grown wild
with the ardor of his work,

743
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:37,026
and turned his eyes from the canvas
rarely, even to regard his wife.

744
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:41,113
And he would not see that the tints
which he spread upon the canvas

745
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:45,368
were drawn from the cheeks of her
who sat beside him.

746
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:50,915
And when many weeks had passed,
and but little remained to do,

747
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:55,127
save one brush upon the mouth
and one tint upon the eye,

748
01:17:55,295 --> 01:17:59,548
the spirit of the lady again flickered up
as the flame within a lamp.

749
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:04,387
And then the brush was given,
and then the tint was placed.

750
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,099
And, for one moment,
the painter stood entranced

751
01:18:08,266 --> 01:18:10,768
before the work he had wrought.

752
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,105
But in the next, while he yet gazed,

753
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:16,982
he grew tremulous and aghast,

754
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:21,362
and crying with a loud voice,
"This is indeed Life itself!"

755
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,865
turned suddenly to regard his beloved:

756
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:27,034
She was dead!"

757
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:38,546
I'd like to go to the Louvre.

758
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,799
No, I don't like looking at pictures.

759
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,472
Why? Art and beauty are life!

760
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,644
I adore you.

761
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,438
And I love you.

762
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,073
Why not come and live with me?

763
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:08,909
Yes. I'll tell Raoul it's all over.

764
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:20,212
Let me at least put my coat on
or I'll catch cold!

765
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:22,298
Stop acting hysterical.

766
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,056
No, Raoul, not now!

767
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:33,184
Stop acting hysterical!

768
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:35,561
You know each other?

769
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,954
What did I do wrong?

770
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:57,166
You must take anyone who pays.

771
01:19:57,334 --> 01:20:00,878
Not anyone.
Sometimes it's degrading.

772
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:03,798
See? That's where you're wrong.

773
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:15,476
The movies are a drag.
Weekdays we're too busy,

774
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,145
and on Sundays
there's always a line.

775
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:24,652
- Where are you going?
- Taking them back to their car.

776
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,321
Why did you make me come?

777
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,865
You're going with them.

778
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,328
HADES AND SONS

779
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:39,351
Well, are you going?

780
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:56,577
First the girl.

781
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:07,755
First the money.

782
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,219
Get the money.

783
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,338
There's 100,000 missing.

784
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,256
Don't move.

785
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,717
Don't think I won't shoot
just because of the girl.

786
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,678
No, don't shoot me!

787
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,433
You shoot.
I forgot to load.

788
01:23:02,305 --> 01:23:08,644
