2
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,347
Good day.

3
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,923
I'll see you next week.

4
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,244
Don't read and eat.

5
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:39,262
- Is it good?
- Yes, it is.

6
00:19:57,124 --> 00:20:01,288
I used less water than last time,
so it tastes better.

7
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:30,006
You're not eating much.
You look unwell.

8
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:26,267
Won't you have some fruit?

9
00:23:59,283 --> 00:24:02,818
We got a letter from
Aunt Fernande in Canada.

10
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,445
I'll read it to you.

11
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,134
Dear Jeanne, dear Sylvain.

12
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:06,715
Forgive me for not responding sooner.

13
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:09,520
I often think of you and Belgium.

14
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:13,939
But school has started and I'm busy.
Time just flies.

15
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:17,316
Suddenly it's winter again.

16
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:20,860
There's a lot of snow
and I don't go out much.

17
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,367
The kids couldn't go to school
because the roads were blocked.

18
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:31,367
I'm home all the time.
Without a car you just sink in the snow.

19
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,835
Jack's teaching me to drive. I need
to learn, because of the great distances.

20
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:40,670
He says I should adopt the norms
of this country.

21
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:45,547
All women here can drive,
but I'm afraid I'll never learn.

22
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:49,845
But now the cars
are all covered in snow.

23
00:25:49,977 --> 00:25:52,100
The kids are very tough.

24
00:25:52,229 --> 00:25:53,688
They're real Canadians.

25
00:25:53,814 --> 00:25:57,978
Jane is almost too tall,
but otherwise she's fine.

26
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,601
I hope you'll see them this summer.

27
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:04,688
We have a guest room
and Sylvain can stay with his nephew.

28
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:09,072
You might even meet a man.
Jack thinks you should remarry.

29
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:11,956
You're too pretty to be alone.

30
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:16,543
George has been dead six years now.
You're very tough.

31
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,083
You only say you want to be alone
because you don't want to complain.

32
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:24,171
I often cry when I think about you.

33
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:28,004
Jack's coming soon
and I need to set the table.

34
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,631
Many kisses to both of you.

35
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:33,389
Your loving sister and aunt, Fernande.

36
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:39,061
PS: Last month I sent Jeanne a present
by boat.

37
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:03,460
What could that present be?

38
00:27:05,469 --> 00:27:07,296
Do you want to go?

39
00:27:20,651 --> 00:27:23,522
The Enemy by Charles Baudelaire.

40
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:28,824
<i>My youth consisted of
dark thunder storms</i>

41
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:32,735
<i>interrupted at times
by a radiant sun</i>

42
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:37,201
<i>the thunder and rain
were so tempestuous</i>

43
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:41,996
<i>that scarcely any fruit
could ripen in my yard</i>

44
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:45,547
<i>now I'm in the autumn of my years</i>

45
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:47,799
<i>and I have a need for...</i>

46
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:49,939
A rake.

47
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:53,971
<i>And I have a need
for a rake and spade</i>

48
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:57,600
<i>to once more gather the earth</i>

49
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:03,151
<i>in which the water digs deep tombs.</i>

50
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:04,902
Once more.

51
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:08,315
The Enemy by Charles Baudelaire.

52
00:28:09,408 --> 00:28:12,859
<i>My youth consisted of
dark thunder storms</i>

53
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:16,079
<i>interrupted at times
by a radiant sun</i>

54
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:22,252
- the thunder...
<i>- thunder and rain were so tempestuous</i>

55
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:25,463
<i>that scarcely any fruit
could ripen in my yard</i>

56
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:28,129
<i>now I'm in the autumn of my years</i>

57
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,214
<i>and I have need for a rake and spade</i>

58
00:28:31,347 --> 00:28:34,265
<i>to once more gather the earth</i>

59
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:37,310
<i>in which the water digs deep tombs.</i>

60
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:42,806
You've developed an accent.

61
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:46,441
Yes. I can almost pronounce the R
the way Jan does.

62
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,441
They no longer make fun of me
at school.

63
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:54,864
Perhaps, but nobody forced you
to go to the Flemish school.

64
00:28:54,995 --> 00:28:56,869
Yes... your friend.

65
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:18,517
Can you pronounce the R like I do?

66
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:44,198
Come here.

67
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:58,256
You like it long, don't you?

68
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:20,324
I'm almost out of wool.

69
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:38,736
Is today Tuesday?

70
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:48,307
Always reading.
Just like your dad.

71
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:53,316
You always say that.
How did you meet my father?

72
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,231
- Why ask me that now?
- It says 'miracle' here.

73
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:03,159
Aunt Fernande always said
it was a miracle that she met Jack.

74
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:06,658
Yes, he came to liberate us in 1944.

75
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:11,538
He gave us gum and chocolate
and we gave him flowers.

76
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:15,751
I met your dad after the Americans left.

77
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:19,633
I lived with my aunts.
My parents were dead.

78
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:23,346
One Saturday, I went to the woods
with a friend.

79
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:25,931
I don't remember the weather.

80
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:31,483
My friend knew him.
You've seen her in pictures.

81
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:35,274
After that we got together.
I was a billing clerk.

82
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:38,773
I didn't earn much
and the aunts were no fun.

83
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:43,320
I didn't know if I wanted to marry,
but that's what people did.

84
00:40:43,454 --> 00:40:45,743
That was just what you did.

85
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:51,247
The aunts said: He's decent and
he has money. He'll make you happy.

86
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:53,704
But I still had doubts.

87
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,628
I really wanted a place of my own
and a child.

88
00:40:59,762 --> 00:41:05,218
Suddenly his business went under
and then we married.

89
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:08,387
That could happen after the war.

90
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:13,099
My aunts then said
a pretty girl like me could do better.

91
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:17,018
I could get a man
who would give me a good life.

92
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:21,982
They said he was ugly and so on,
but I didn't listen.

93
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:26,661
Did you still want to sleep with him
if he was ugly?

94
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:30,952
Ugly or not, that doesn't matter.

95
00:41:31,085 --> 00:41:34,620
And sleeping with him was just a detail.

96
00:41:34,755 --> 00:41:37,709
And I had you.
He wasn't that ugly.

97
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:40,593
Would you like to remarry?

98
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,756
No, getting used to someone else
again...

99
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:46,178
With someone you love.

100
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:50,104
Well...

101
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:52,305
If I were a woman...

102
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,232
...I wouldn't be able to sleep
with someone I didn't love.

103
00:41:57,361 --> 00:42:00,481
You don't know,
you're not a woman.

104
00:42:00,614 --> 00:42:04,149
- Lights out?
- Yes, alright.

105
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:06,858
Sleep tight.

106
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:07,012
END OF FIRST DAY

107
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:04,223
Did you wash your hands?

108
00:56:06,377 --> 00:56:09,294
Can I have some more today?

109
01:09:04,947 --> 01:09:07,272
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

110
01:09:14,582 --> 01:09:17,369
- Thank you, madam.
- Thank you, sir.

111
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,147
- Hello, madam. Are you well?
- Yes.

112
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,028
Can you have these shoes ready
by tomorrow?

113
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:55,576
My son's wearing the other pair now.
His old ones have holes in them.

114
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,451
I'll have a look.

115
01:10:03,464 --> 01:10:06,667
The heels too, right?

116
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:09,588
Tomorrow at four. Is that alright?

117
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,504
Is your son doing well?
Yes, fine.

118
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:18,219
You're pleased with him, right?
Does he listen? That's good.

119
01:10:18,354 --> 01:10:22,683
- I'd be lost without him.
- You can collect them at four.

120
01:11:15,745 --> 01:11:18,829
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- Good day.

121
01:11:18,956 --> 01:11:21,114
Will you come for coffee this afternoon?

122
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:24,417
Not this afternoon.
Maybe next week.

123
01:11:24,545 --> 01:11:26,205
See you later then.

124
01:23:29,854 --> 01:23:33,305
- Here you go.
- You weren't eating, were you?

125
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,398
What will you have today?

126
01:23:35,526 --> 01:23:38,942
On Wednesday,
I have schnitzel, peas and carrots.

127
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:41,776
I couldn't think of anything today.

128
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:46,902
I would be fine
if I just had a sandwich and nothing else.

129
01:23:47,037 --> 01:23:49,824
Now that I smoke, I've lost my appetite.

130
01:23:49,957 --> 01:23:52,792
But the kids need meat.

131
01:23:52,918 --> 01:23:58,079
So I went to buy some.
There was a queue at the butcher's.

132
01:23:58,215 --> 01:24:03,554
If I'd gone earlier or later,
I wouldn't have had to queue.

133
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:09,515
But now I could listen to the other orders
and work out what to buy myself.

134
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:12,514
But that made it even harder.

135
01:24:12,646 --> 01:24:16,691
One woman ordered
pork and veal mince and I thought:

136
01:24:16,817 --> 01:24:21,859
She'll make meatloaf.
I had that yesterday, with applesauce.

137
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:25,903
Then I thought:
No, silly. She'll make meatballs.

138
01:24:26,035 --> 01:24:33,081
But that's so corny.
When it was my turn, I still didn't know.

139
01:24:33,209 --> 01:24:37,420
In the end, I ordered the same
as the woman in front of me.

140
01:24:37,546 --> 01:24:40,749
A kilo of veal for 300 francs.

141
01:24:41,967 --> 01:24:46,629
It's enough for two days
and none of us like veal.

142
01:24:46,764 --> 01:24:51,509
So the kids won't eat it.
And there's no vitamins in veal.

143
01:24:51,644 --> 01:24:55,344
You can't eat fish either.
It can kill you.

144
01:24:56,732 --> 01:24:59,852
I wish they could eat school meals.

145
01:24:59,985 --> 01:25:05,276
But my husband thinks they're bad
and the kids are already too short.

146
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:08,444
But if I had my way...

147
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:16,333
He'll be gone all week next week.
I'll miss him.

148
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:20,078
I'll be at my mum's.
The kids will have to eat at school.

149
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:24,342
They'll get used to eating with other kids.
It's better.

150
01:25:24,468 --> 01:25:27,006
And my husband can't complain...

151
01:25:27,138 --> 01:25:31,764
- Does your son eat school meals?
- Yes, he's not fussy.

152
01:25:31,892 --> 01:25:37,053
- My husband wasn't fussy either.
- Neither is mine, but the kids...

153
01:25:37,189 --> 01:25:39,597
That's unavoidable though.

154
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:46,321
You get used to it.
I have to go.

155
01:25:46,449 --> 01:25:48,157
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

156
01:29:24,834 --> 01:29:26,577
Madam...

157
01:29:27,378 --> 01:29:31,328
Do you have a skein of wool
in this colour, madam?

158
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:36,134
I think that's it.

159
01:29:49,024 --> 01:29:50,898
Yes, that's it.

160
01:29:51,026 --> 01:29:53,482
That's it, alright.

161
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,543
Thank you.

162
01:33:31,789 --> 01:33:33,367
Goodbye, madam.

163
01:35:38,958 --> 01:35:39,989
Good day.

164
01:37:08,714 --> 01:37:10,173
See you Thursday.

165
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:26,610
Madam.

166
01:42:33,789 --> 01:42:36,161
A bag of potatoes.

167
01:48:34,775 --> 01:48:36,234
Mum.

168
01:48:43,451 --> 01:48:48,445
- Your hair is tangled.
- I have overcooked the potatoes.

169
01:49:53,437 --> 01:49:55,644
Don't read and eat.

170
01:51:37,583 --> 01:51:39,789
You'll have to wait.

171
01:51:40,795 --> 01:51:44,875
I've put the meat and vegetables
on a low heat.

172
01:52:28,759 --> 01:52:30,419
A little longer.

173
01:52:44,442 --> 01:52:47,857
I didn't make mash.
We'll have that tomorrow.

174
01:53:31,363 --> 01:53:34,982
You must be hungry.
You've been swimming.

175
01:53:36,327 --> 01:53:40,194
- I didn't go. Neither did Jan.
- Why not?

176
01:53:40,331 --> 01:53:44,578
Jan kept me company.
I said I had a headache.

177
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:49,372
We stayed in the sick ward.
We had our swimming test today.

178
01:53:49,507 --> 01:53:52,840
I don't like it when you do such things.

179
01:54:09,819 --> 01:54:12,226
I must reply to Aunt Fernande.

180
01:54:12,363 --> 01:54:14,854
The potatoes are probably done.

181
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:28,630
- Aren't we going to switch the radio on?
- Yes.

182
01:58:42,967 --> 01:58:46,667
Can't you do it?
Is it because of the radio?

183
01:58:46,804 --> 01:58:49,591
Maybe it's because of the singer.

184
01:58:49,724 --> 01:58:52,808
I don't know what to reply...

185
02:01:08,028 --> 02:01:11,057
Can we not go tonight?
We ate rather late.

186
02:01:11,119 --> 02:01:12,516
Sure.

187
02:03:30,504 --> 02:03:34,668
If you want,
you can bring Jan with you tomorrow.

188
02:03:35,801 --> 02:03:38,506
I bet he's in love with the nurse.

189
02:03:38,637 --> 02:03:42,220
He wouldn't go on the tram.
He had things to do.

190
02:03:42,349 --> 02:03:47,474
When I drove past the school,
he was still there.

191
02:03:47,605 --> 02:03:50,890
He has a book that explains a lot.

192
02:03:51,025 --> 02:03:53,183
The length of the climax, the orgasm...

193
02:03:53,319 --> 02:03:56,569
He says we're the right age for women.

194
02:03:56,697 --> 02:03:58,986
He doesn't want a girl.

195
02:03:59,116 --> 02:04:04,407
A man's member is sword,
that he has to plunge in deep.

196
02:04:04,538 --> 02:04:08,121
I say: A sword hurts.
He says: Yes.

197
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:12,378
Just like fire.
Where's the fun in that?

198
02:04:12,505 --> 02:04:14,830
You shouldn't say such things.

199
02:04:14,965 --> 02:04:18,584
He told me everything when I was ten.

200
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:21,756
I asked: Does dad do that with mum?

201
02:04:21,889 --> 02:04:26,634
I hated dad because of it.
I wanted to die.

202
02:04:26,769 --> 02:04:29,805
I thought his death
was God's wrath.

203
02:04:29,939 --> 02:04:32,477
I don't believe in God anymore.

204
02:04:32,608 --> 02:04:35,277
He said it wasn't just to create me.

205
02:04:35,403 --> 02:04:40,859
Then I pretended to have nightmares
and called you, so he couldn't...

206
02:04:40,991 --> 02:04:43,992
...penetrate you.

207
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:46,196
That wasn't necessary.

208
02:04:46,330 --> 02:04:48,868
It's late. I'll switch the light off.

209
02:04:48,999 --> 02:04:51,288
Alright...

210
02:04:51,419 --> 02:04:54,337
- Mum...
- It's late.

211
02:04:54,463 --> 02:04:56,670
Sleep tight.

212
02:05:49,769 --> 02:05:53,303
END OF DAY TWO

213
02:13:13,295 --> 02:13:15,965
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yes.

214
02:13:23,139 --> 02:13:24,965
Your button.

215
02:14:58,234 --> 02:15:00,061
Sylvain...

216
02:22:27,850 --> 02:22:30,306
- Are they gone?
- Is it empty?

217
02:23:49,098 --> 02:23:51,636
Half a loaf of bread.

218
02:23:51,767 --> 02:23:54,175
Have you got a bag?

219
02:24:05,948 --> 02:24:09,483
- The bag?
- I'll take a new one.

220
02:24:16,917 --> 02:24:19,491
Here you go. 10 francs 50. Thanks.

221
02:24:26,177 --> 02:24:28,086
Here you go.

222
02:24:34,018 --> 02:24:37,434
- Thanks.
- Goodbye, madam.

223
02:51:58,370 --> 02:52:00,410
- Hello.
- Bye.

224
02:52:01,082 --> 02:52:02,540
Thanks.

225
02:57:22,027 --> 02:57:25,278
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

226
02:58:57,039 --> 02:58:59,115
Miss?

227
02:59:03,587 --> 02:59:07,667
Do you have a button like this?

228
02:59:07,800 --> 02:59:10,338
I've already checked.

229
02:59:12,138 --> 02:59:14,759
- Maybe that one?
- No.

230
02:59:14,890 --> 02:59:19,469
- They're not the same.
- Then I don't have one. Sorry.

231
02:59:19,854 --> 02:59:22,523
Goodbye then.

232
02:59:41,459 --> 02:59:47,461
They're hard to find. My sister Fernande
sent them from Canada.

233
02:59:47,590 --> 02:59:51,754
She sent this years ago.
Sylvain just started wearing it.

234
02:59:51,886 --> 02:59:54,424
It was too big for him.

235
02:59:54,555 --> 02:59:59,217
He was six when my sister stayed here
for three months.

236
02:59:59,351 --> 03:00:04,642
He slept in the room with me and
my husband, who was still alive then...

237
03:00:04,774 --> 03:00:09,934
...and she slept on the sofa
with Jonathan. She calls him John.

238
03:00:10,071 --> 03:00:13,938
John was 5, but he was
bigger and stronger than Sylvain.

239
03:00:14,075 --> 03:00:19,698
If I ask her for such a button,
the model may be out of production.

240
03:00:19,830 --> 03:00:23,448
They say Europe is five years
behind America.

241
03:00:23,584 --> 03:00:25,826
That's why I still had hope.

242
03:00:25,961 --> 03:00:30,707
You won't find one like it.
Just change all the buttons.

243
03:00:30,841 --> 03:00:36,962
Then the coat will be as new.
It's just like getting a haircut.

244
03:00:58,911 --> 03:01:01,532
I've never seen such a button.

245
03:01:02,957 --> 03:01:06,291
Maybe you'll find one in the square.

246
03:02:07,354 --> 03:02:09,846
- Madam?
- Is Gisele not here?

247
03:02:09,982 --> 03:02:14,858
- She stops working at four.
- Then I'll just have a coffee.

248
03:03:00,116 --> 03:03:01,943
Here you go, madam.

248
03:03:02,305 --> 03:03:08,601
