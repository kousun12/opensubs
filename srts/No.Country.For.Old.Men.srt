00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,834
I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.

3
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,919
Hard to believe.

4
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,506
My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

5
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,345
Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,347
I think he's pretty proud of that.

7
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,975
I know I was.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,980
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

9
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,650
Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,360
That's the younger Jim.

11
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,906
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.

12
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,451
I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.

13
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,538
Never missed a chance to do so.

14
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:24,168
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

15
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,088
Can't help but wonder
how they'd have operated these times.

16
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:33,011
There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.

17
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:36,431
My arrest and my testimony.

18
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:41,102
He killed a 14-year-old girl.

19
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,646
Paper said it was a crime of passion...

20
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,608
...but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.

21
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,904
Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.

22
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:53,865
Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.

23
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,534
Said he knew he was going to hell.

24
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:59,037
Be there in about 15 minutes.

25
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,873
I don't know what to make of that.

26
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,167
I sure do don't.

27
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:10,006
The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,717
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

29
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:18,515
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

30
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:22,852
But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out.

31
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:26,397
...and meet something I don't understand.

32
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,904
A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.

33
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,658
He'd have to say, "OK.

34
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:42,830
I'll be part of this world. "

35
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,252
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

36
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,420
He had some sort of thing on him...

37
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:53,049
...like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something...

38
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,468
...and a hose that run down his sleeve.

39
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:58,054
Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?

40
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,890
You got me. Well,
you can look at it when you get in.

41
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:05,436
- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, I got it under control.

42
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:46,163
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car please, sir.

43
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,456
What is that?

44
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,875
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

45
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,678
- What is that for?
- Would you?...

46
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,806
Would you hold still please, sir?

47
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:34,796
You hold still.

48
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:45,724
Shit.

49
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,979
Agua.

50
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:20,023
Agua.

51
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,871
Agua.

52
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,708
I ain't got no water.

53
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:41,837
Agua.

54
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,471
Agua.

55
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:54,808
I told you I ain't got no agua.

56
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:10,992
Do you speak English?

57
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:15,371
Where's the last guy?

58
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:20,168
ÜItimo hombre, last man standing. There
must have been one. Where'd he go?

59
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:29,427
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

60
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:34,599
Hay lobos.

61
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:37,018
There ain't no lobos.

62
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,827
You stopped to watch
your backtrack.

63
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,706
Now shoot my dumb ass.

64
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:04,587
But if you stop...

65
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:06,673
...you stopped in shade.

66
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:10,881
Yeah.

67
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:20,015
Hmm.

68
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,935
Mmm.

69
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,951
My place is wrong?

70
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:23,622
Yours is the first place
Danzer and Dora will look if they...

71
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,707
If they know.

72
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,795
- What's in the satchel?
- It's full of money.

73
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,089
That would be the day.

74
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,926
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- At the gettin' place.

75
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,430
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. I found it.

76
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:45,852
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

77
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:48,438
What'd you get for that thing?

78
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,817
You don't need to know everything,
Carla Jean.

79
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:56,321
- I need to know that.
- Keep running that mouth of yours...

80
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,990
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

81
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:02,160
- Big talk.
- Keep it up.

82
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:05,330
Fine. I don't want to know.

83
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:09,377
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

84
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,170
That'll work.

85
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:26,853
All right.

86
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,986
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

87
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:40,700
- What're you doing, baby?
- I'm going out.

88
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,910
Going where?

89
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:45,872
A little something I forgot to do,
but I'll be back.

90
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:49,292
- And what're you gonna do?
- I'm fixing to do something.

91
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,587
...dumber than hell, but I'm going anyways.

92
00:15:53,713 --> 00:15:56,215
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

93
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,385
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

94
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:05,766
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

95
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:02,316
- How much?
- Sixty-nine cents.

96
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:03,859
And the gas?

97
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:06,487
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

98
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:11,742
- What way would that be?
- Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

99
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:16,830
What business is it of yours
where I'm from...

100
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,416
...friendo?

101
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:25,089
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

102
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,508
I was just passing the time.

103
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:32,680
If you don't want to accept that,
I don't know what else I can do for you.

104
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:39,144
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

105
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,403
- Is something wrong?
- With what?

106
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:48,863
With anything.

107
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:54,118
Is that what you're asking me?
Is there something wrong with anything?

108
00:21:54,201 --> 00:21:57,621
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

109
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:04,546
- Well, I need to see about closing now.
- See about closing?

110
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:06,590
- Yes, sir.
- What time do you close?

111
00:22:06,631 --> 00:22:08,884
- Now. We close now.
- Now is not a time.

112
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:13,096
- What time do you close?
- Generally around dark. At dark.

113
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:18,894
You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

114
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:21,062
Sir?

115
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:24,816
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

116
00:22:27,194 --> 00:22:29,905
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

117
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:33,575
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

118
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:37,287
Oh.

119
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:41,499
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

120
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,126
I could come back then.

121
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,629
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

122
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:47,464
Yeah, you said that.

123
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:53,261
- Well, I got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?

124
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:57,432
- Yes, I do.
- You lived here all your life?

125
00:22:58,975 --> 00:23:03,104
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

126
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:06,775
You married into it?

127
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:10,779
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

128
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,783
Raised a family there. In Temple.

129
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:18,954
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

130
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:24,292
- If that's the way you want to put it.
- Well, I don't have some way to put it.

131
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,086
That's the way it is.

132
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:37,097
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

133
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,144
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

134
00:23:42,228 --> 00:23:45,815
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't say.

135
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,194
- Call it.
- Call it?

136
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:52,405
- Yes.
- For what?

137
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:53,698
Just call it.

138
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:59,954
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

139
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:03,457
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.

140
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:06,627
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.

141
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,214
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

142
00:24:10,298 --> 00:24:12,675
You just didn't know it.

143
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,761
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

144
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:20,141
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

145
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,937
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

146
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:26,355
You have to say. Call it.

147
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:29,901
Well, look,
I need to know what I stand to win.

148
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:32,778
- Everything.
- How's that?

149
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:35,448
You stand to win everything. Call it.

150
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,955
All right. Heads, then.

151
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:49,003
Well done.

152
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,090
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

153
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:56,219
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

154
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,262
Where do you want me to put it?

155
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,473
Anywhere not in your pocket.

156
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:05,019
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

157
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:09,607
Which it is.

158
00:25:20,535 --> 00:25:21,869
Llewelyn?

159
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:26,458
What the hell?

160
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:30,837
- Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

161
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:34,341
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

162
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:35,717
Well, how come?

163
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:40,055
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

164
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:44,226
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

165
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,562
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

166
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,189
- How long do we?...
- What point would you quit.

167
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:52,442
...bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

168
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:54,736
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

169
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,447
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, I'm home!"?

170
00:25:57,531 --> 00:25:59,825
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

171
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:02,744
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

172
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:07,958
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

173
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:10,294
Oh, baby, things happen.

174
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,213
Come on, I can't take them back.

175
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:37,654
Mind riding bitch?

176
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,836
- This his truck?
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:26:56,924 --> 00:26:58,717
Got a screwgie?

178
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:06,517
- Who cut his tires?
- Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

179
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,480
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

180
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:16,736
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

181
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:20,698
These are some ripe petunias.

182
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:22,659
Hold this, please.

183
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,210
Want it?

184
00:27:34,379 --> 00:27:37,966
- Getting anything on this?
- Not a bleep.

185
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:39,717
All right.

186
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:44,222
Give me that.

187
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,734
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

188
00:27:56,818 --> 00:28:00,280
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

189
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:01,364
Step in there.

190
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:04,409
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

191
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:07,579
- I love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

192
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:10,582
- Be careful.
- Always am.

193
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:12,375
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

194
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,294
Don't hurt no one.

195
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:18,423
If you say so.

196
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:56,462
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,881
We should've brought wienies.

198
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:01,884
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

199
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:05,179
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

200
00:29:05,262 --> 00:29:10,267
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

201
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:14,522
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway...

202
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:20,027
...swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

203
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:22,488
That's very linear, sheriff.

204
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:26,742
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,911
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

206
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:33,165
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

207
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:37,503
Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here...

208
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:41,048
I can tell you, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

209
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:46,011
It's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

210
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:48,222
You can see the sipes real clear.

211
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:54,019
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

212
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:57,857
I know this truck.

213
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,526
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

214
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:03,404
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

215
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:07,366
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

216
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:11,203
- I kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

217
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:16,041
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

218
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:21,297
This is just
a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

219
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,634
Yup. Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

220
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:33,185
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

221
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:36,396
Couple of. 45 ACPs.

222
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:40,233
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

223
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:45,071
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

224
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,240
I don't know.

225
00:30:52,037 --> 00:30:54,956
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

226
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,500
These boys appear to be managerial.

227
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:01,880
I think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

228
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,341
Wild West over there.

229
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,763
- It's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

230
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:12,682
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

231
00:31:12,766 --> 00:31:14,601
Then, whoa, differences, and...

232
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:19,689
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

233
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:23,068
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

234
00:31:23,151 --> 00:31:25,445
Probably I don't.

235
00:31:27,531 --> 00:31:30,158
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, sheriff?

236
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:34,955
If it ain't,
it'll do till the mess gets here.

237
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:30,821
Yes, sir?

238
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:34,951
- I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

239
00:33:35,034 --> 00:33:37,954
- Yes, I did.
- Well, I'd say he's at work.

240
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:40,957
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

241
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,084
I can't say.

242
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:46,003
Where does he work?

243
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:50,550
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

244
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:52,844
Where does he work?

245
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:55,930
Did you not hear me?

246
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:59,101
We can't give out no information.

247
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:25,377
- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

248
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,381
- You can't afford one?
- I don't want to register it.

249
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:32,134
- Look, I'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

250
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:33,218
Yes, I do.

251
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:39,308
- I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.
- I got a good one. Oughta even out.

252
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:42,811
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

253
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:44,771
- Mama's gonna raise hell.
- Mm-hm.

254
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:46,815
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

255
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:50,694
- Well, you should be used to that.
- I'm used to lots of things.

256
00:34:50,777 --> 00:34:53,739
- I work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

257
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:55,699
You are retired.

258
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:57,659
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

259
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:04,416
- You are coming back, ain't you?
- I shall return.

260
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,465
Sheriff's department!

261
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:15,469
Look at that lock.

262
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,599
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

263
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:27,231
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

264
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:32,319
Sheriff's department!

265
00:35:58,096 --> 00:36:01,266
- I believe they done lit a shuck.
- I believe you're right.

266
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:05,478
- That from the lock?
- Probably must be.

267
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:09,232
- So when was he here, sheriff?
- I don't know. Oh...

268
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:11,776
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

269
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:17,782
- Still sweating.
- Oh, sheriff! We just missed him!

270
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:22,078
We gotta circulate this on radio.

271
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:23,413
All right.

272
00:36:24,455 --> 00:36:26,541
What do we circulate?

273
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:32,505
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

274
00:36:35,258 --> 00:36:39,804
- Oh, sheriff, that's aggravating.
- I'm ahead of you there.

275
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:45,643
Think this boy Moss has got any notion
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches.

276
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,646
- That are hunting him?
- I don't know. He ought to.

277
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,779
He's seen the same things I've seen and
it certainly made an impression on me.

278
00:37:03,077 --> 00:37:05,371
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

279
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:06,706
Someplace cheap.

280
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,295
- You tell me the option.
- Do what now?

281
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:16,007
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

282
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:20,595
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

283
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:29,688
This is Roberto's
Automotive. I'm not in right now.

284
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:31,482
Please leave a message.

285
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:34,356
- Hello?
- Is Llewelyn there?

286
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,859
Llewelyn? No, he ain't.

287
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,861
You expect him?

288
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:43,740
Now why would
I expect him? Who is this?

289
00:39:51,331 --> 00:39:54,751
- May I help you?
- Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans?

290
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,169
Shoulder, size 11?

291
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:58,922
- I'll check.
- You all sell socks?

292
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:02,467
- Just white.
- Well, white's all I wear. Bathroom?

293
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,746
Don't stop.
Just ride me up past those rooms.

294
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,834
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

295
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,211
I wanna see if someone's here.

296
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:47,722
Keep going. Don't stop.

297
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:50,766
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here.

298
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,768
It's all right.

299
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:56,522
Why don't I just set you down
right here and we won't argue about it?

300
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:59,901
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

301
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:03,112
You're in the jackpot,
and I'm trying to get you out of it.

302
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:05,239
Take me to another motel.

303
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:56,749
Lab reports from Austin
on that boy by the highway.

304
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:59,001
- What was the bullet?
- Wasn't no bullet.

305
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,215
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

306
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:09,220
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

307
00:42:09,303 --> 00:42:10,429
No, sir.

308
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:14,600
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

309
00:42:14,684 --> 00:42:16,936
- Yes, sir.
- You telling me he shot this boy.

310
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:19,355
...and then went digging around
with a knife?

311
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:23,776
- Sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't either.

312
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:26,153
Can I freshen that there for you,
sheriff?

313
00:42:26,237 --> 00:42:29,156
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

314
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,952
Ranger and the DEA
are headed back out to the scene.

315
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,621
Gonna join 'em?

316
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:37,291
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

317
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:41,670
- No, sir.
- Well, then I guess I can skip it.

318
00:42:56,185 --> 00:43:00,480
- Twelve-gauge. You need shells?
- Yeah, double-ought.

319
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:04,401
- Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.
- Y'all got camping supplies?

320
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:07,779
Tent poles. You already have the tent?

321
00:43:07,863 --> 00:43:09,615
Well, something like that.

322
00:43:09,698 --> 00:43:12,534
Give me the model number on the tent,
I can order poles.

323
00:43:12,618 --> 00:43:14,995
- Never mind. I want a tent.
- What kind?

324
00:43:15,078 --> 00:43:17,080
The kind with most poles.

325
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:42,147
- Could I get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

326
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:44,858
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

327
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:47,444
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

328
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:49,863
And do you have a map of the rooms?

329
00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:52,616
Well, yeah, we had a sorta one.

330
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:56,537
Oh, thank you.

331
00:43:59,915 --> 00:44:01,917
How about 38?

332
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,672
Well, you can have the one right next to
yours if you want, 137. It ain't took.

333
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:10,801
- No, 38 will be fine.
- Well, that's got two double beds.

334
00:50:46,158 --> 00:50:47,451
How'd you find that?

335
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,813
You shouldn't be doin' that.

336
00:52:37,896 --> 00:52:41,400
Even a young man like you.

337
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:45,154
- Doin' what?
- Hitchhiking.

338
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:52,620
Dangerous.

339
00:53:10,638 --> 00:53:14,184
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

340
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:17,770
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

341
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:20,231
When did you last see him?

342
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:21,774
Uh...

343
00:53:21,858 --> 00:53:25,028
...November 28th, last year.

344
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:28,364
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

345
00:53:29,157 --> 00:53:33,286
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

346
00:53:33,328 --> 00:53:38,833
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

347
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:42,670
Got a loose cannon here.

348
00:53:42,754 --> 00:53:46,174
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

349
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:49,135
- Yes, sir.
- This account will give up.

350
00:53:49,177 --> 00:53:53,473
$1,200 in any 24-hour period.
That's up from a thousand.

351
00:53:53,556 --> 00:53:57,727
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

352
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,896
OK.

353
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:03,733
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

354
00:54:03,816 --> 00:54:07,695
I just wanna know your opinion of him,
in general.

355
00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:13,243
- Just how dangerous is he?
- Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

356
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:15,495
He's bad enough you called me.

357
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:20,083
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

358
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,960
There's plenty of them around.

359
00:54:22,043 --> 00:54:24,712
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday...

360
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:28,384
...and two others in that
colossal goat-fuck out in the desert.

361
00:54:28,467 --> 00:54:31,387
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

362
00:54:33,722 --> 00:54:38,018
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

363
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:43,357
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

364
00:54:45,067 --> 00:54:47,486
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

365
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:50,531
Could you validate my parking ticket?

366
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:57,204
- An attempt at humor, I suppose?
- I'm sorry.

367
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:07,339
You know, I counted the floors
to this building from the street.

368
00:55:07,423 --> 00:55:09,925
- And?
- There's one missing.

369
00:55:12,928 --> 00:55:14,638
We'll look into it.

370
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:37,453
One room. One night.

371
00:55:37,536 --> 00:55:41,165
- That'll be $26.
- Alrighty.

372
00:55:45,252 --> 00:55:46,503
You on all night?

373
00:55:46,587 --> 00:55:49,798
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

374
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:55,888
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

375
00:55:55,971 --> 00:55:59,016
There's someone
who been looking for me. Not police.

376
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:01,810
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

377
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:04,104
And by anyone, I mean any swinging dick.

378
00:56:46,606 --> 00:56:48,733
There just ain't no way.

379
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:28,952
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

380
01:02:29,035 --> 01:02:30,870
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

381
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:40,228
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

382
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:06,004
Were you in a car accident?

383
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,342
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

384
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:13,178
Lemme see the money.

385
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:17,682
Were you in a car accident?

386
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:22,395
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

387
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:26,400
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

388
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:34,700
Give it here.

389
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:43,709
Gimme that beer too.

390
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:48,256
How much?

391
01:06:48,965 --> 01:06:50,758
Brian, give him the beer.

392
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:06,000
Ah!

393
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:04,393
Medico...

394
01:09:05,644 --> 01:09:07,688
...por favor.

395
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:12,522
Wait up!

396
01:11:15,024 --> 01:11:18,361
...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me...

397
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:20,613
...and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

398
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:24,242
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight...

399
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:28,162
...though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight.

400
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:31,666
...instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

401
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:34,086
Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

402
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:36,547
It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

403
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:40,217
But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...

404
01:12:37,525 --> 01:12:41,779
Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.

405
01:13:10,975 --> 01:13:13,018
Any word on those vehicles yet?

406
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:16,106
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

407
01:13:16,189 --> 01:13:20,777
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

408
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:23,321
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

409
01:13:23,405 --> 01:13:25,657
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

410
01:13:25,699 --> 01:13:28,493
No. Lord, no.

411
01:13:28,577 --> 01:13:30,620
There's this month's checks.

412
01:13:31,162 --> 01:13:34,165
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

413
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:36,960
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

414
01:13:37,002 --> 01:13:40,005
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

415
01:13:40,088 --> 01:13:41,339
That's cordial of him.

416
01:13:43,258 --> 01:13:44,926
Can I get you to call Loretta...

417
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:47,679
...tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

418
01:13:47,762 --> 01:13:50,765
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

419
01:13:50,849 --> 01:13:53,560
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

420
01:13:53,643 --> 01:13:56,438
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

421
01:13:56,521 --> 01:14:00,233
Uh-huh. Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

422
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,323
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

423
01:14:07,032 --> 01:14:11,036
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

424
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:14,164
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

425
01:14:14,206 --> 01:14:17,042
Might come to three before it's over.

426
01:14:18,543 --> 01:14:19,878
What the hell?

427
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,055
Sheriff?

428
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:32,682
You looked at your load lately?

429
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:38,772
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

430
01:14:38,855 --> 01:14:44,152
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

431
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:46,571
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

432
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:49,032
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

433
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:51,785
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

434
01:14:51,868 --> 01:14:53,745
You get your ass outta here.

435
01:14:56,873 --> 01:15:00,169
Buenos dias.

436
01:15:00,253 --> 01:15:03,839
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself.

437
01:15:03,923 --> 01:15:06,509
...when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

438
01:15:06,926 --> 01:15:09,720
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

439
01:15:11,097 --> 01:15:13,015
I know that.

440
01:15:14,392 --> 01:15:15,518
I've seen him.

441
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:18,938
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

442
01:15:19,772 --> 01:15:21,148
Huh.

443
01:15:21,232 --> 01:15:23,985
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

444
01:15:24,068 --> 01:15:26,153
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

445
01:15:26,237 --> 01:15:28,114
How would you describe him?

446
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:32,368
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

447
01:15:32,451 --> 01:15:34,996
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

448
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:37,540
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

449
01:15:37,623 --> 01:15:40,960
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

450
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:44,213
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

451
01:15:44,297 --> 01:15:46,966
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

452
01:15:47,049 --> 01:15:49,886
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

453
01:15:49,969 --> 01:15:54,640
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

454
01:15:56,934 --> 01:16:00,229
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

455
01:16:00,313 --> 01:16:03,065
- What did you do?
- Welder.

456
01:16:03,149 --> 01:16:05,401
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

457
01:16:05,484 --> 01:16:07,987
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

458
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,864
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

459
01:16:09,947 --> 01:16:11,866
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

460
01:16:11,949 --> 01:16:13,409
What did I say?

461
01:16:14,994 --> 01:16:19,665
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

462
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:23,544
So was I.

463
01:16:23,628 --> 01:16:25,963
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

464
01:16:27,548 --> 01:16:32,762
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

465
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,516
It's too late. I spent it.

466
01:16:37,517 --> 01:16:39,895
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey...

467
01:16:39,978 --> 01:16:42,731
...and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

468
01:16:44,608 --> 01:16:47,069
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

469
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:55,202
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

470
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:06,880
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... About me.

471
01:17:06,964 --> 01:17:08,632
He isn't.

472
01:17:08,715 --> 01:17:12,344
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

473
01:17:12,386 --> 01:17:15,889
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

474
01:17:21,728 --> 01:17:24,022
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

475
01:17:25,065 --> 01:17:27,526
Carson Wells.

476
01:17:27,568 --> 01:17:29,570
Call me when you've had enough.

477
01:17:29,653 --> 01:17:32,614
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

478
01:17:32,698 --> 01:17:36,076
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

479
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:40,581
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

480
01:17:40,664 --> 01:17:45,460
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

481
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:47,754
He's a peculiar man.

482
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:52,885
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs.

483
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:56,638
...or anything like that. Not like you.

484
01:17:57,514 --> 01:17:59,933
Yeah. He's not even like me.

485
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:03,562
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

486
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:08,609
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

487
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,444
Don't know why I did.

488
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:13,447
I told you, I don't know where he is.

489
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,824
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

490
01:18:15,908 --> 01:18:17,701
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

491
01:18:17,784 --> 01:18:21,955
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

492
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:26,878
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

493
01:18:26,961 --> 01:18:30,548
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

494
01:18:30,632 --> 01:18:34,344
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

495
01:18:34,427 --> 01:18:37,430
He won't neither. He never has.

496
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:41,601
He can take all comers.

497
01:18:43,144 --> 01:18:46,773
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

498
01:18:48,608 --> 01:18:52,654
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul...

499
01:18:52,737 --> 01:18:54,572
...truss 'em and slit their throats?

500
01:18:54,656 --> 01:18:57,825
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him.

501
01:18:57,867 --> 01:19:00,161
...and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

502
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,790
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

503
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:06,459
You'll excuse the... Well...

504
01:19:06,501 --> 01:19:09,087
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head...

505
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:12,173
...but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

506
01:19:12,257 --> 01:19:14,884
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

507
01:19:14,968 --> 01:19:18,596
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

508
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,892
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer...

509
01:19:22,976 --> 01:19:24,769
...the issue is not certain.

510
01:19:32,443 --> 01:19:37,115
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I can make him safe.

511
01:19:40,952 --> 01:19:45,707
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

512
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:49,836
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

513
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:53,047
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

514
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:59,804
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

515
01:20:03,391 --> 01:20:05,186
My mind wanders.

516
01:21:28,394 --> 01:21:30,604
Hello, Carson.

517
01:21:32,898 --> 01:21:34,483
Let's go to your room.

518
01:21:46,829 --> 01:21:49,416
You don't have to do this.

519
01:21:49,499 --> 01:21:53,503
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

520
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:58,341
- You could.
- Make it worth your while...

521
01:21:58,383 --> 01:22:02,596
...take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

522
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:05,015
And everybody just walks away.

523
01:22:06,349 --> 01:22:08,435
An ATM.

524
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:15,525
I know where the satchel is.

525
01:22:15,609 --> 01:22:17,861
If you knew, you would have it with you.

526
01:22:17,944 --> 01:22:21,865
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

527
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:26,328
- I know something better.
- What's that?

528
01:22:26,369 --> 01:22:27,871
Where it's going to be.

529
01:22:29,539 --> 01:22:33,043
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me.

530
01:22:33,126 --> 01:22:35,629
...and placed at my feet.

531
01:22:37,505 --> 01:22:40,425
You don't know to a certainty.

532
01:22:40,508 --> 01:22:44,471
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

533
01:22:44,554 --> 01:22:47,224
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

534
01:22:48,308 --> 01:22:52,938
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

535
01:22:58,068 --> 01:23:00,904
You go to hell.

536
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:05,033
All right.
Let me ask you something.

537
01:23:06,826 --> 01:23:11,581
If the rule you followed
brought you to this...

538
01:23:11,665 --> 01:23:14,251
...of what use was the rule?

539
01:23:19,839 --> 01:23:23,760
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

540
01:23:24,928 --> 01:23:27,264
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

541
01:23:27,347 --> 01:23:29,516
I mean the nature of you.

542
01:23:33,813 --> 01:23:39,652
You... You can have the money, Anton.

543
01:24:19,734 --> 01:24:22,111
- Hello?
- Yes?

544
01:24:23,779 --> 01:24:26,991
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

545
01:24:29,243 --> 01:24:31,746
Not in the sense that you mean.

546
01:24:33,915 --> 01:24:37,919
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

547
01:24:38,002 --> 01:24:40,963
You know who it is.

548
01:24:41,047 --> 01:24:44,217
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

549
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,636
I think you do.

550
01:24:46,677 --> 01:24:48,429
Do you know where I'm going?

551
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,098
Why would I care where you're going?

552
01:24:51,182 --> 01:24:53,809
I know where you are.

553
01:24:53,893 --> 01:24:56,103
Yeah, where am I?

554
01:24:56,187 --> 01:25:00,441
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

555
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:03,444
Do you know where I'm going?

556
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:09,325
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

557
01:25:09,367 --> 01:25:10,952
You know she won't be there.

558
01:25:11,035 --> 01:25:13,497
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

559
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:15,707
So, what're you going up there for?

560
01:25:19,378 --> 01:25:21,880
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

561
01:25:23,882 --> 01:25:25,384
Nope.

562
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:29,721
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

563
01:25:30,722 --> 01:25:33,308
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

564
01:25:33,392 --> 01:25:38,021
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

565
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:42,568
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

566
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:46,572
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

567
01:25:49,825 --> 01:25:53,245
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

568
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:55,497
Decided to make you a project of mine.

569
01:25:55,581 --> 01:25:58,208
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

570
01:26:02,546 --> 01:26:05,090
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

571
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:06,925
None of the three had ID on 'em...

572
01:26:07,009 --> 01:26:10,762
...but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

573
01:26:10,846 --> 01:26:15,726
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

574
01:26:17,728 --> 01:26:19,646
Yes, sir.

575
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,316
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

576
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:25,027
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

577
01:26:25,861 --> 01:26:28,864
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for...

578
01:26:28,947 --> 01:26:31,450
...it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

579
01:26:31,533 --> 01:26:35,454
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

580
01:26:35,537 --> 01:26:38,415
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

581
01:26:38,457 --> 01:26:42,461
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

582
01:26:42,544 --> 01:26:46,006
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

583
01:26:46,089 --> 01:26:49,801
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard...

584
01:26:49,885 --> 01:26:52,179
...cash their Social Security checks.

585
01:26:53,222 --> 01:26:56,392
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

586
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,687
Maybe their television set was broke.

587
01:26:59,771 --> 01:27:03,149
And this went on until, here, I quote...

588
01:27:03,191 --> 01:27:07,111
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises.

589
01:27:07,153 --> 01:27:09,155
...wearing only a dog collar. "

590
01:27:10,907 --> 01:27:13,910
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

591
01:27:13,993 --> 01:27:17,664
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

592
01:27:17,747 --> 01:27:20,500
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

593
01:27:27,173 --> 01:27:30,927
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

594
01:27:33,012 --> 01:27:35,056
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

595
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:39,644
Tell me something.

596
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:42,730
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

597
01:27:44,524 --> 01:27:47,026
I don't know. American citizens?

598
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:50,029
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

599
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:52,073
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

600
01:27:52,156 --> 01:27:54,450
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

601
01:27:54,534 --> 01:27:58,454
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

602
01:27:58,538 --> 01:27:59,873
If I don't, they don't.

603
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:02,000
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

604
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:04,752
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

605
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:07,714
Well, I got an overcoat on.

606
01:28:09,007 --> 01:28:10,925
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

607
01:28:11,009 --> 01:28:13,052
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

608
01:28:13,678 --> 01:28:15,847
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

609
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:18,391
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

610
01:28:18,474 --> 01:28:21,060
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion...

611
01:28:21,144 --> 01:28:24,731
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

612
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,403
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

613
01:28:30,445 --> 01:28:34,032
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

614
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:46,462
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

615
01:28:46,545 --> 01:28:49,089
- I need everything else.
- OK.

616
01:28:49,673 --> 01:28:52,760
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

617
01:28:52,843 --> 01:28:55,179
No, sir. It's unusual.

618
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:11,654
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

619
01:29:11,737 --> 01:29:14,240
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care...

620
01:29:14,323 --> 01:29:16,617
...and don't you hang up this phone.

621
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:19,870
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

622
01:29:21,038 --> 01:29:22,915
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

623
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:26,126
- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?

624
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:29,964
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

625
01:29:30,005 --> 01:29:33,300
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

626
01:29:34,009 --> 01:29:37,179
You're hurt, ain't you?

627
01:29:37,263 --> 01:29:39,515
What makes you say that?

628
01:29:39,598 --> 01:29:43,143
- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!

629
01:29:43,227 --> 01:29:46,814
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

630
01:29:46,897 --> 01:29:49,358
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

631
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:51,861
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

632
01:29:51,944 --> 01:29:55,155
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money...

633
01:29:55,197 --> 01:29:57,992
...he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

634
01:29:58,075 --> 01:30:00,744
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

635
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:04,290
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

636
01:30:04,331 --> 01:30:06,250
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

637
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,836
Be all right? I got the cancer!

638
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:10,880
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

639
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:44,998
Hmm.

640
01:30:45,457 --> 01:30:46,958
Who are you?

641
01:30:51,338 --> 01:30:53,173
- Me?
- Yes.

642
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:55,425
Nobody.

643
01:30:55,508 --> 01:30:57,219
Accounting.

644
01:30:58,637 --> 01:31:01,097
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

645
01:31:03,433 --> 01:31:05,393
He feels...

646
01:31:05,477 --> 01:31:09,105
He felt that the more people looking...

647
01:31:09,189 --> 01:31:14,110
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

648
01:31:14,194 --> 01:31:15,570
I see.

649
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:20,116
Are you going to shoot me?

650
01:31:26,373 --> 01:31:28,166
That depends.

651
01:31:30,544 --> 01:31:32,128
Do you see me?

652
01:31:35,257 --> 01:31:37,884
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

653
01:31:37,926 --> 01:31:42,264
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

654
01:31:42,305 --> 01:31:46,518
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good. "

655
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:50,230
Here we are, 90 degree heat...

656
01:31:50,313 --> 01:31:55,735
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

657
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:59,239
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

658
01:31:59,281 --> 01:32:02,451
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

659
01:32:02,535 --> 01:32:05,454
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

660
01:32:14,422 --> 01:32:17,633
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

661
01:32:17,717 --> 01:32:21,470
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

662
01:32:21,512 --> 01:32:25,349
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

663
01:32:25,433 --> 01:32:27,602
You need help with the bags, madam?

664
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:31,564
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

665
01:32:31,647 --> 01:32:34,400
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

666
01:32:34,483 --> 01:32:39,155
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

667
01:32:39,238 --> 01:32:42,158
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

668
01:32:42,241 --> 01:32:44,785
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

669
01:32:44,869 --> 01:32:46,162
Oh...

670
01:32:46,245 --> 01:32:47,997
Carla Jean, how are you?

671
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:52,084
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

672
01:32:52,168 --> 01:32:54,629
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

673
01:32:54,712 --> 01:32:56,797
Um...

674
01:32:56,881 --> 01:32:59,467
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail...

675
01:32:59,508 --> 01:33:03,054
- But it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

676
01:33:03,137 --> 01:33:06,974
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

677
01:33:07,016 --> 01:33:08,976
Yes, ma'am.

678
01:33:09,018 --> 01:33:13,648
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you.

679
01:33:13,731 --> 01:33:16,901
...who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

680
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:20,905
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

681
01:33:20,988 --> 01:33:23,866
He never thinks he needs any.

682
01:33:23,908 --> 01:33:27,828
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

683
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:31,332
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

684
01:33:40,258 --> 01:33:42,343
What's the problem there, neighbor?

685
01:33:42,426 --> 01:33:46,807
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

686
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,396
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

687
01:33:52,437 --> 01:33:56,525
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

688
01:33:56,567 --> 01:34:00,779
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

689
01:34:00,863 --> 01:34:04,616
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

690
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:09,162
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? Brother, I been there.

691
01:34:09,705 --> 01:34:12,916
Well, there's airstrips.

692
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,335
The airport is El Paso.

693
01:34:15,419 --> 01:34:17,212
If you want someplace specific...

694
01:34:17,254 --> 01:34:21,216
...you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

695
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,510
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

696
01:34:23,594 --> 01:34:26,471
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

697
01:34:26,555 --> 01:34:29,433
What are you talking about?

698
01:34:45,324 --> 01:34:49,328
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

699
01:34:49,411 --> 01:34:53,373
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

700
01:34:53,457 --> 01:34:55,834
Yeah, that's me.

701
01:34:55,918 --> 01:34:58,712
I got beers in my room.

702
01:34:58,795 --> 01:35:02,674
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

703
01:35:02,758 --> 01:35:05,594
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

704
01:35:05,636 --> 01:35:08,263
- Well, half.
- What else then?

705
01:35:08,347 --> 01:35:13,185
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

706
01:35:13,268 --> 01:35:15,938
But no one ever sees that.

707
01:35:16,021 --> 01:35:19,316
Beer! That's what's comin'.

708
01:35:19,399 --> 01:35:22,194
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

709
01:35:22,277 --> 01:35:24,780
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

710
01:35:26,615 --> 01:35:28,743
Beer leads to more beer.

711
01:36:15,665 --> 01:36:17,125
You all right?

712
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:24,257
Call the police.

713
01:36:30,096 --> 01:36:32,390
Your local law enforcement.

714
01:36:33,725 --> 01:36:35,685
I'm not on their radio.

715
01:36:35,768 --> 01:36:38,521
I met his daughter at the...

716
01:37:25,945 --> 01:37:29,156
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

717
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:32,785
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

718
01:37:32,868 --> 01:37:35,204
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

719
01:37:35,287 --> 01:37:37,831
I suppose so.

720
01:37:37,915 --> 01:37:40,084
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

721
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:45,339
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

722
01:37:46,507 --> 01:37:49,176
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

723
01:37:49,927 --> 01:37:53,138
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

724
01:37:53,222 --> 01:37:56,267
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago.

725
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:59,478
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns.

726
01:37:59,562 --> 01:38:02,690
...with green hair, bones in their noses...

727
01:38:02,773 --> 01:38:05,317
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

728
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:06,944
Signs and wonders.

729
01:38:07,027 --> 01:38:11,615
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

730
01:38:11,657 --> 01:38:13,409
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

731
01:38:13,492 --> 01:38:17,329
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

732
01:38:17,371 --> 01:38:18,956
Not the one thing.

733
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:21,917
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

734
01:38:22,001 --> 01:38:25,129
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

735
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:28,549
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

736
01:38:28,632 --> 01:38:32,011
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

737
01:38:32,052 --> 01:38:34,013
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

738
01:38:34,054 --> 01:38:37,850
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

739
01:38:37,892 --> 01:38:40,477
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

740
01:38:40,519 --> 01:38:43,439
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

741
01:38:44,648 --> 01:38:46,483
He shoots a desk clerk one day...

742
01:38:46,525 --> 01:38:51,030
...walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

743
01:38:51,113 --> 01:38:52,616
It's hard to believe.

744
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:55,952
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

745
01:38:56,036 --> 01:39:01,374
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

746
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:04,461
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

747
01:39:04,544 --> 01:39:06,922
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

748
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:42,264
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

749
01:42:42,347 --> 01:42:45,434
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

750
01:42:45,517 --> 01:42:47,060
- You heard it?
- How's that?

751
01:42:47,144 --> 01:42:51,356
Did you hear my?...
You're having fun with me.

752
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:55,777
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

753
01:42:55,861 --> 01:43:00,657
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

754
01:43:00,741 --> 01:43:02,910
How many of them things you got now?

755
01:43:02,951 --> 01:43:05,495
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

756
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:08,874
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got. "

757
01:43:08,957 --> 01:43:13,170
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

758
01:43:16,256 --> 01:43:19,968
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

759
01:43:21,345 --> 01:43:24,640
I got to say, you're looking older.

760
01:43:24,723 --> 01:43:26,266
I am older.

761
01:43:27,392 --> 01:43:29,853
Got a letter from your wife.

762
01:43:29,937 --> 01:43:34,358
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

763
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:38,111
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

764
01:43:41,198 --> 01:43:44,117
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

765
01:43:51,625 --> 01:43:53,460
How fresh is that coffee?

766
01:43:53,502 --> 01:43:59,258
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

767
01:44:01,177 --> 01:44:03,513
That man that shot you died in prison?

768
01:44:05,890 --> 01:44:08,142
Angola. Yeah.

769
01:44:08,184 --> 01:44:11,020
What'd you done he'd a been released?

770
01:44:11,062 --> 01:44:13,982
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

771
01:44:14,023 --> 01:44:15,650
Wouldn't be no point in it.

772
01:44:15,733 --> 01:44:19,028
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

773
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:22,824
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back.

774
01:44:22,866 --> 01:44:26,536
...what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

775
01:44:26,619 --> 01:44:29,581
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

776
01:44:30,665 --> 01:44:34,794
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

777
01:44:37,589 --> 01:44:41,634
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

778
01:44:41,718 --> 01:44:44,012
I don't know.

779
01:44:46,723 --> 01:44:48,349
I feel overmatched.

780
01:44:52,937 --> 01:44:55,523
I always figured when I got older...

781
01:44:55,607 --> 01:45:00,528
God would... Sort of
come into my life somehow.

782
01:45:03,531 --> 01:45:04,574
And He didn't.

783
01:45:08,453 --> 01:45:10,079
And I don't blame Him.

784
01:45:12,457 --> 01:45:15,418
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

785
01:45:16,044 --> 01:45:17,837
You don't know what He thinks.

786
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:35,772
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers...

787
01:45:35,855 --> 01:45:38,483
...put it in their museum.

788
01:45:38,566 --> 01:45:42,195
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

789
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:46,825
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

790
01:45:49,078 --> 01:45:53,958
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

791
01:45:53,999 --> 01:45:56,961
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

792
01:45:57,044 --> 01:46:00,673
Well, they was ahead of him.

793
01:46:00,756 --> 01:46:03,467
Shot him in his doorway.

794
01:46:03,551 --> 01:46:06,136
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

795
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:10,140
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

796
01:46:10,224 --> 01:46:14,645
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

797
01:46:15,771 --> 01:46:19,942
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

798
01:46:20,818 --> 01:46:22,653
Left out.

799
01:46:24,822 --> 01:46:28,284
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

800
01:46:28,367 --> 01:46:31,495
Shot through the left lung.

801
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:36,125
And that was that... As they say.

802
01:46:39,378 --> 01:46:40,671
When'd he die?

803
01:46:41,964 --> 01:46:45,342
Nineteen zero and, uh... Nine?

804
01:46:45,384 --> 01:46:49,221
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

805
01:46:49,305 --> 01:46:52,975
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

806
01:46:53,058 --> 01:46:58,105
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

807
01:47:01,025 --> 01:47:03,819
What you got ain't nothin' new.

808
01:47:04,945 --> 01:47:07,656
This country is hard on people.

809
01:47:11,368 --> 01:47:13,495
You can't stop what's coming.

810
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:17,374
It ain't all waitin' on you.

811
01:47:20,211 --> 01:47:22,087
That's vanity.

812
01:48:23,024 --> 01:48:25,402
I knew this wasn't done with.

813
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:30,115
I ain't got the money.

814
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:36,413
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

815
01:48:38,331 --> 01:48:42,878
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

816
01:48:43,879 --> 01:48:45,755
I wouldn't worry about it.

817
01:48:48,383 --> 01:48:49,926
I need to sit down.

818
01:49:05,233 --> 01:49:07,319
You got no cause to hurt me.

819
01:49:07,402 --> 01:49:11,240
No. But I gave my word.

820
01:49:12,658 --> 01:49:16,287
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

821
01:49:19,332 --> 01:49:22,084
That don't make sense.

822
01:49:22,168 --> 01:49:25,379
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

823
01:49:25,463 --> 01:49:28,966
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

824
01:49:29,008 --> 01:49:31,886
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

825
01:49:36,891 --> 01:49:38,893
Not like that.

826
01:49:40,478 --> 01:49:42,313
Not like you say.

827
01:49:48,361 --> 01:49:50,196
You don't have to do this.

828
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:52,532
People always say the same thing.

829
01:49:54,242 --> 01:49:55,493
What do they say?

830
01:49:56,619 --> 01:49:58,829
They say, "You don't have to do this. "

831
01:50:00,039 --> 01:50:05,086
- You don't.
- OK.

832
01:50:10,216 --> 01:50:12,176
This is the best I can do.

833
01:50:13,302 --> 01:50:14,303
Call it.

834
01:50:18,808 --> 01:50:22,395
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

835
01:50:24,814 --> 01:50:27,441
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

836
01:50:27,525 --> 01:50:31,863
- Call it.
- No.

837
01:50:31,904 --> 01:50:34,448
I ain't gonna call it.

838
01:50:37,827 --> 01:50:39,245
Call it.

839
01:50:39,287 --> 01:50:42,373
The coin don't have no say.

840
01:50:42,415 --> 01:50:44,292
It's just you.

841
01:50:46,836 --> 01:50:49,922
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

842
01:52:32,526 --> 01:52:35,697
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

843
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:38,199
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

844
01:52:38,241 --> 01:52:41,202
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

845
01:52:41,244 --> 01:52:43,538
All right.

846
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:47,458
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

847
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:50,712
What'll you take for the shirt?

848
01:52:55,258 --> 01:52:58,219
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

849
01:53:05,226 --> 01:53:08,688
Look at that fucking bone.

850
01:53:08,771 --> 01:53:09,939
Tie this for me.

851
01:53:11,065 --> 01:53:13,026
Just tie it, just tie it.

852
01:53:31,044 --> 01:53:35,048
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

853
01:53:35,131 --> 01:53:37,634
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

854
01:53:37,717 --> 01:53:40,845
Take it and... You didn't see me.

855
01:53:40,929 --> 01:53:43,181
I was already gone.

856
01:53:43,264 --> 01:53:44,557
Yes, sir.

857
01:53:48,937 --> 01:53:52,482
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

858
01:53:52,565 --> 01:53:56,945
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

859
01:54:17,091 --> 01:54:19,718
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

860
01:54:19,802 --> 01:54:23,639
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

861
01:54:24,932 --> 01:54:28,435
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

862
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:34,900
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... Better not.

863
01:54:39,196 --> 01:54:42,533
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

864
01:54:42,616 --> 01:54:46,996
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

865
01:54:47,037 --> 01:54:49,874
They always is to the party concerned.

866
01:54:52,126 --> 01:54:54,712
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

867
01:54:57,172 --> 01:55:02,261
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

868
01:55:02,344 --> 01:55:05,306
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

869
01:55:05,389 --> 01:55:09,268
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

870
01:55:09,351 --> 01:55:12,438
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well...

871
01:55:12,521 --> 01:55:15,232
...but it was about meeting him in town...

872
01:55:15,316 --> 01:55:17,902
...somewheres,
and he give me some money.

873
01:55:17,985 --> 01:55:19,612
I think I lost it.

874
01:55:21,405 --> 01:55:26,327
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

875
01:55:26,368 --> 01:55:30,497
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

876
01:55:30,539 --> 01:55:34,001
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

877
01:55:34,043 --> 01:55:37,463
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

878
01:55:37,546 --> 01:55:40,007
And he rode past me and kept on going...

879
01:55:40,049 --> 01:55:42,843
...never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

880
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:48,265
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

881
01:55:50,059 --> 01:55:54,063
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn...

882
01:55:54,146 --> 01:55:56,065
...the way people used to do, and I...

883
01:55:56,106 --> 01:55:58,693
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it...

884
01:55:58,777 --> 01:56:00,529
'bout the color of the moon.

885
01:56:02,030 --> 01:56:04,366
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

886
01:56:05,242 --> 01:56:07,035
...going on ahead.

887
01:56:07,619 --> 01:56:12,499
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

888
01:56:16,086 --> 01:56:19,089
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

889
01:56:23,635 --> 01:56:25,595
And then I woke up.

890
01:57:32,204 --> 01:57:34,789
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

891
01:57:34,831 --> 01:57:36,666
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

892
02:00:43,772 --> 02:00:46,024
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

893
02:01:09,757 --> 02:01:11,843
Were you in a car accident?

894
02:01:13,761 --> 02:01:16,139
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

895
02:01:17,849 --> 02:01:18,975
Lemme see the money.

896
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:23,521
Were you in a car accident?

897
02:01:25,815 --> 02:01:28,234
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

898
02:01:28,276 --> 02:01:32,238
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

899
02:01:38,953 --> 02:01:40,538
Give it here.

900
02:01:48,421 --> 02:01:49,547
Gimme that beer too.

901
02:01:52,425 --> 02:01:54,052
How much?

902
02:01:54,802 --> 02:01:56,596
Brian, give him the beer.

903
02:03:08,919 --> 02:03:11,839
Ah!

904
02:04:08,729 --> 02:04:10,189
Medico...

905
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,484
...por favor.

906
02:06:17,068 --> 02:06:18,361
Wait up!

907
02:06:20,821 --> 02:06:24,200
...and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me...

908
02:06:24,242 --> 02:06:26,410
...and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!

909
02:06:26,494 --> 02:06:30,039
Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight...

910
02:06:30,122 --> 02:06:33,960
...though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight.

911
02:06:34,043 --> 02:06:37,463
...instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.

912
02:06:37,547 --> 02:06:39,882
Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.

913
02:06:39,966 --> 02:06:42,343
It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.

914
02:06:42,385 --> 02:06:46,013
But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...

915
02:07:43,321 --> 02:07:47,575
Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.

916
02:08:16,772 --> 02:08:18,815
Any word on those vehicles yet?

917
02:08:18,899 --> 02:08:21,944
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

918
02:08:21,985 --> 02:08:26,573
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

919
02:08:26,657 --> 02:08:29,117
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

920
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:31,453
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

921
02:08:31,495 --> 02:08:34,331
No. Lord, no.

922
02:08:34,373 --> 02:08:36,458
There's this month's checks.

923
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,962
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

924
02:08:40,045 --> 02:08:42,756
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

925
02:08:42,839 --> 02:08:45,801
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

926
02:08:45,884 --> 02:08:47,135
That's cordial of him.

927
02:08:49,054 --> 02:08:50,722
Can I get you to call Loretta...

928
02:08:50,806 --> 02:08:53,517
...tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

929
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:56,562
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

930
02:08:56,645 --> 02:08:59,356
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

931
02:08:59,439 --> 02:09:02,234
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

932
02:09:02,317 --> 02:09:06,029
Uh-huh. Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

933
02:09:09,616 --> 02:09:12,160
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

934
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:16,832
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

935
02:09:16,915 --> 02:09:19,960
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

936
02:09:20,043 --> 02:09:22,880
Might come to three before it's over.

937
02:09:24,339 --> 02:09:25,674
What the hell?

938
02:09:34,516 --> 02:09:35,893
Sheriff?

939
02:09:36,435 --> 02:09:38,479
You looked at your load lately?

940
02:09:40,064 --> 02:09:44,569
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

941
02:09:44,652 --> 02:09:49,949
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

942
02:09:50,033 --> 02:09:52,410
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

943
02:09:52,452 --> 02:09:54,829
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

944
02:09:54,913 --> 02:09:57,582
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

945
02:09:57,665 --> 02:09:59,584
You get your ass outta here.

946
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:05,965
Buenos dias.

947
02:10:06,049 --> 02:10:09,636
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself.

948
02:10:09,719 --> 02:10:12,305
...when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

949
02:10:12,764 --> 02:10:15,516
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

950
02:10:16,935 --> 02:10:18,811
I know that.

951
02:10:20,188 --> 02:10:21,314
I've seen him.

952
02:10:21,397 --> 02:10:24,734
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

953
02:10:25,610 --> 02:10:26,945
Huh.

954
02:10:27,028 --> 02:10:29,781
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

955
02:10:29,864 --> 02:10:31,950
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

956
02:10:32,033 --> 02:10:33,910
How would you describe him?

957
02:10:33,952 --> 02:10:38,164
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

958
02:10:38,248 --> 02:10:40,792
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

959
02:10:40,875 --> 02:10:43,336
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

960
02:10:43,419 --> 02:10:46,756
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

961
02:10:46,798 --> 02:10:50,009
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

962
02:10:50,093 --> 02:10:52,804
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

963
02:10:52,845 --> 02:10:55,682
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

964
02:10:55,765 --> 02:11:00,436
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

965
02:11:02,730 --> 02:11:06,025
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

966
02:11:06,109 --> 02:11:08,862
- What did you do?
- Welder.

967
02:11:08,945 --> 02:11:11,197
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

968
02:11:11,281 --> 02:11:13,783
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

969
02:11:13,867 --> 02:11:15,660
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

970
02:11:15,743 --> 02:11:17,662
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

971
02:11:17,745 --> 02:11:19,205
What did I say?

972
02:11:20,791 --> 02:11:25,504
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

973
02:11:27,339 --> 02:11:29,341
So was I.

974
02:11:29,425 --> 02:11:31,760
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

975
02:11:33,345 --> 02:11:38,559
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

976
02:11:39,518 --> 02:11:42,354
It's too late. I spent it.

977
02:11:43,355 --> 02:11:45,691
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey...

978
02:11:45,774 --> 02:11:48,527
...and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

979
02:11:50,404 --> 02:11:52,865
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

980
02:11:57,077 --> 02:12:00,998
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

981
02:12:08,297 --> 02:12:12,718
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... About me.

982
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:14,428
He isn't.

983
02:12:14,511 --> 02:12:18,140
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

984
02:12:18,224 --> 02:12:21,685
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

985
02:12:27,566 --> 02:12:29,818
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

986
02:12:30,861 --> 02:12:33,322
Carson Wells.

987
02:12:33,405 --> 02:12:35,366
Call me when you've had enough.

988
02:12:35,449 --> 02:12:38,410
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

989
02:12:38,494 --> 02:12:41,914
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

990
02:12:41,956 --> 02:12:46,418
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

991
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:51,257
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

992
02:12:51,340 --> 02:12:53,551
He's a peculiar man.

993
02:12:53,592 --> 02:12:58,722
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs.

994
02:12:58,764 --> 02:13:02,434
...or anything like that. Not like you.

995
02:13:03,311 --> 02:13:05,730
Yeah. He's not even like me.

996
02:13:05,772 --> 02:13:09,401
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

997
02:13:12,112 --> 02:13:14,406
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

998
02:13:14,447 --> 02:13:16,241
Don't know why I did.

999
02:13:16,283 --> 02:13:19,244
I told you, I don't know where he is.

1000
02:13:19,286 --> 02:13:21,621
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

1001
02:13:21,705 --> 02:13:23,498
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

1002
02:13:23,582 --> 02:13:27,794
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

1003
02:13:27,836 --> 02:13:32,674
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

1004
02:13:32,757 --> 02:13:36,344
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

1005
02:13:36,428 --> 02:13:40,140
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

1006
02:13:40,223 --> 02:13:43,268
He won't neither. He never has.

1007
02:13:43,977 --> 02:13:47,397
He can take all comers.

1008
02:13:48,982 --> 02:13:52,611
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

1009
02:13:54,404 --> 02:13:58,450
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul...

1010
02:13:58,533 --> 02:14:00,368
...truss 'em and slit their throats?

1011
02:14:00,452 --> 02:14:03,622
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him.

1012
02:14:03,663 --> 02:14:05,999
...and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

1013
02:14:06,917 --> 02:14:09,586
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

1014
02:14:09,669 --> 02:14:12,255
You'll excuse the... Well...

1015
02:14:12,339 --> 02:14:14,883
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head...

1016
02:14:14,966 --> 02:14:17,969
...but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

1017
02:14:18,053 --> 02:14:20,680
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

1018
02:14:20,764 --> 02:14:24,392
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

1019
02:14:24,476 --> 02:14:28,688
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer...

1020
02:14:28,772 --> 02:14:30,565
...the issue is not certain.

1021
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:42,911
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I can make him safe.

1022
02:14:46,749 --> 02:14:51,504
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

1023
02:14:51,546 --> 02:14:55,675
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

1024
02:14:55,716 --> 02:14:58,844
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

1025
02:15:01,847 --> 02:15:05,601
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

1026
02:15:09,230 --> 02:15:10,982
My mind wanders.

1027
02:16:34,191 --> 02:16:36,401
Hello, Carson.

1028
02:16:38,695 --> 02:16:40,280
Let's go to your room.

1029
02:16:52,626 --> 02:16:55,212
You don't have to do this.

1030
02:16:55,295 --> 02:16:59,299
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

1031
02:17:01,260 --> 02:17:04,137
- You could.
- Make it worth your while...

1032
02:17:04,179 --> 02:17:08,392
...take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

1033
02:17:08,475 --> 02:17:10,811
And everybody just walks away.

1034
02:17:12,145 --> 02:17:14,231
An ATM.

1035
02:17:18,235 --> 02:17:21,321
I know where the satchel is.

1036
02:17:21,405 --> 02:17:23,699
If you knew, you would have it with you.

1037
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:27,661
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

1038
02:17:29,204 --> 02:17:32,124
- I know something better.
- What's that?

1039
02:17:32,207 --> 02:17:33,667
Where it's going to be.

1040
02:17:35,335 --> 02:17:38,839
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me.

1041
02:17:38,922 --> 02:17:41,425
...and placed at my feet.

1042
02:17:43,302 --> 02:17:46,221
You don't know to a certainty.

1043
02:17:46,305 --> 02:17:50,267
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

1044
02:17:50,350 --> 02:17:53,061
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

1045
02:17:54,104 --> 02:17:58,734
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

1046
02:18:03,906 --> 02:18:06,742
You go to hell.

1047
02:18:07,576 --> 02:18:10,830
All right.
Let me ask you something.

1048
02:18:12,624 --> 02:18:17,420
If the rule you followed
brought you to this...

1049
02:18:17,462 --> 02:18:20,048
...of what use was the rule?

1050
02:18:25,637 --> 02:18:29,557
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

1051
02:18:30,725 --> 02:18:33,102
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

1052
02:18:33,144 --> 02:18:35,313
I mean the nature of you.

1053
02:18:39,609 --> 02:18:45,448
You... You can have the money, Anton.

1054
02:19:25,530 --> 02:19:27,907
- Hello?
- Yes?

1055
02:19:29,576 --> 02:19:32,829
Is, uh, Carson Wells there?

1056
02:19:35,039 --> 02:19:37,542
Not in the sense that you mean.

1057
02:19:39,711 --> 02:19:43,715
- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?

1058
02:19:43,798 --> 02:19:46,801
You know who it is.

1059
02:19:46,843 --> 02:19:50,013
- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.

1060
02:19:50,096 --> 02:19:52,432
I think you do.

1061
02:19:52,515 --> 02:19:54,226
Do you know where I'm going?

1062
02:19:54,310 --> 02:19:56,896
Why would I care where you're going?

1063
02:19:56,979 --> 02:19:59,648
I know where you are.

1064
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:01,901
Yeah, where am I?

1065
02:20:01,984 --> 02:20:06,238
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

1066
02:20:07,156 --> 02:20:09,241
Do you know where I'm going?

1067
02:20:11,076 --> 02:20:15,122
- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.

1068
02:20:15,206 --> 02:20:16,749
You know she won't be there.

1069
02:20:16,832 --> 02:20:19,293
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

1070
02:20:19,376 --> 02:20:21,503
So, what're you going up there for?

1071
02:20:25,174 --> 02:20:27,676
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

1072
02:20:29,678 --> 02:20:31,180
Nope.

1073
02:20:31,263 --> 02:20:35,559
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

1074
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,104
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

1075
02:20:39,188 --> 02:20:43,859
Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.

1076
02:20:45,945 --> 02:20:48,364
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

1077
02:20:48,405 --> 02:20:52,368
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

1078
02:20:55,621 --> 02:20:59,083
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

1079
02:20:59,124 --> 02:21:01,293
Decided to make you a project of mine.

1080
02:21:01,377 --> 02:21:04,046
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

1081
02:21:08,342 --> 02:21:10,886
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

1082
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:12,763
None of the three had ID on 'em...

1083
02:21:12,805 --> 02:21:16,600
...but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

1084
02:21:16,642 --> 02:21:21,522
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

1085
02:21:23,524 --> 02:21:25,442
Yes, sir.

1086
02:21:25,526 --> 02:21:28,112
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

1087
02:21:28,195 --> 02:21:30,823
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

1088
02:21:31,657 --> 02:21:34,660
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for...

1089
02:21:34,743 --> 02:21:37,247
...it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

1090
02:21:37,330 --> 02:21:41,293
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

1091
02:21:41,334 --> 02:21:44,212
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

1092
02:21:44,296 --> 02:21:48,258
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

1093
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:51,803
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

1094
02:21:51,887 --> 02:21:55,640
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard...

1095
02:21:55,682 --> 02:21:57,976
...cash their Social Security checks.

1096
02:21:59,019 --> 02:22:02,188
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

1097
02:22:03,356 --> 02:22:05,483
Maybe their television set was broke.

1098
02:22:05,567 --> 02:22:08,945
And this went on until, here, I quote...

1099
02:22:08,987 --> 02:22:12,908
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises.

1100
02:22:12,991 --> 02:22:14,951
...wearing only a dog collar. "

1101
02:22:16,703 --> 02:22:19,706
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

1102
02:22:19,789 --> 02:22:23,501
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

1103
02:22:23,543 --> 02:22:26,296
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

1104
02:22:33,011 --> 02:22:36,723
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

1105
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:40,852
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

1106
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:45,482
Tell me something.

1107
02:22:45,524 --> 02:22:48,527
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

1108
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:52,822
I don't know. American citizens?

1109
02:22:52,906 --> 02:22:55,825
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

1110
02:22:55,867 --> 02:22:57,869
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

1111
02:22:57,953 --> 02:23:00,247
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

1112
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:04,251
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

1113
02:23:04,334 --> 02:23:05,710
If I don't, they don't.

1114
02:23:05,752 --> 02:23:07,837
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

1115
02:23:07,879 --> 02:23:10,549
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

1116
02:23:11,967 --> 02:23:13,510
Well, I got an overcoat on.

1117
02:23:14,803 --> 02:23:16,721
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

1118
02:23:16,805 --> 02:23:18,849
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

1119
02:23:19,475 --> 02:23:21,686
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

1120
02:23:21,727 --> 02:23:24,230
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

1121
02:23:24,272 --> 02:23:26,858
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion...

1122
02:23:26,941 --> 02:23:30,528
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

1123
02:23:33,239 --> 02:23:36,200
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

1124
02:23:36,242 --> 02:23:39,829
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

1125
02:23:48,838 --> 02:23:52,258
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

1126
02:23:52,341 --> 02:23:54,886
- I need everything else.
- OK.

1127
02:23:55,469 --> 02:23:58,556
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

1128
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:00,975
No, sir. It's unusual.

1129
02:24:13,946 --> 02:24:17,450
- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

1130
02:24:17,533 --> 02:24:20,077
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care...

1131
02:24:20,119 --> 02:24:22,455
...and don't you hang up this phone.

1132
02:24:22,496 --> 02:24:25,666
Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.

1133
02:24:26,834 --> 02:24:28,711
- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.

1134
02:24:28,794 --> 02:24:31,964
- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?

1135
02:24:32,006 --> 02:24:35,760
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

1136
02:24:35,801 --> 02:24:39,138
- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?

1137
02:24:39,805 --> 02:24:42,975
You're hurt, ain't you?

1138
02:24:43,059 --> 02:24:45,311
What makes you say that?

1139
02:24:45,394 --> 02:24:48,940
- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!

1140
02:24:49,023 --> 02:24:52,610
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

1141
02:24:52,693 --> 02:24:55,154
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

1142
02:24:55,238 --> 02:24:57,657
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

1143
02:24:57,740 --> 02:25:00,953
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money...

1144
02:25:00,994 --> 02:25:03,830
...he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

1145
02:25:03,872 --> 02:25:06,542
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

1146
02:25:06,625 --> 02:25:10,087
Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?

1147
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:12,047
- She'll be all right.
- All right?

1148
02:25:12,130 --> 02:25:14,633
Be all right? I got the cancer!

1149
02:25:14,716 --> 02:25:16,677
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

1150
02:25:48,333 --> 02:25:50,794
Hmm.

1151
02:25:51,253 --> 02:25:52,754
Who are you?

1152
02:25:57,134 --> 02:25:58,969
- Me?
- Yes.

1153
02:25:59,052 --> 02:26:01,221
Nobody.

1154
02:26:01,305 --> 02:26:03,015
Accounting.

1155
02:26:04,433 --> 02:26:06,894
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

1156
02:26:09,229 --> 02:26:11,231
He feels...

1157
02:26:11,273 --> 02:26:14,902
He felt that the more people looking...

1158
02:26:14,985 --> 02:26:19,907
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

1159
02:26:19,990 --> 02:26:21,408
I see.

1160
02:26:24,286 --> 02:26:25,913
Are you going to shoot me?

1161
02:26:32,169 --> 02:26:33,962
That depends.

1162
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:37,925
Do you see me?

1163
02:26:41,094 --> 02:26:43,681
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

1164
02:26:43,765 --> 02:26:48,061
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

1165
02:26:48,102 --> 02:26:52,315
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good. "

1166
02:26:52,398 --> 02:26:56,069
Here we are, 90 degree heat...

1167
02:26:56,110 --> 02:27:01,533
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

1168
02:27:02,242 --> 02:27:05,036
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

1169
02:27:05,119 --> 02:27:08,289
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

1170
02:27:08,331 --> 02:27:11,292
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

1171
02:27:20,218 --> 02:27:23,471
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

1172
02:27:23,513 --> 02:27:27,267
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

1173
02:27:27,308 --> 02:27:31,145
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

1174
02:27:31,229 --> 02:27:33,398
You need help with the bags, madam?

1175
02:27:33,481 --> 02:27:37,360
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

1176
02:27:37,443 --> 02:27:40,196
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

1177
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:44,993
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

1178
02:27:45,034 --> 02:27:47,996
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

1179
02:27:48,037 --> 02:27:50,623
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

1180
02:27:50,665 --> 02:27:52,000
Oh...

1181
02:27:52,041 --> 02:27:53,835
Carla Jean, how are you?

1182
02:27:53,877 --> 02:27:57,881
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

1183
02:27:57,964 --> 02:28:00,466
Who's Charlie Walser? Uh! Oh...

1184
02:28:00,508 --> 02:28:02,635
Um...

1185
02:28:02,677 --> 02:28:05,263
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail...

1186
02:28:05,346 --> 02:28:08,850
- But it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.

1187
02:28:08,933 --> 02:28:12,770
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

1188
02:28:12,854 --> 02:28:14,772
Yes, ma'am.

1189
02:28:14,856 --> 02:28:19,485
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you.

1190
02:28:19,527 --> 02:28:22,697
...who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

1191
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:26,702
- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.

1192
02:28:26,785 --> 02:28:29,663
He never thinks he needs any.

1193
02:28:29,705 --> 02:28:33,626
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.

1194
02:28:33,709 --> 02:28:37,129
And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.

1195
02:28:46,055 --> 02:28:48,182
What's the problem there, neighbor?

1196
02:28:48,224 --> 02:28:52,603
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

1197
02:28:54,396 --> 02:28:58,192
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

1198
02:28:58,234 --> 02:29:02,321
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

1199
02:29:02,404 --> 02:29:06,575
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

1200
02:29:06,659 --> 02:29:10,412
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

1201
02:29:10,496 --> 02:29:14,959
Just lightin' out for the territories,
huh? Brother, I been there.

1202
02:29:15,501 --> 02:29:18,754
Well, there's airstrips.

1203
02:29:18,796 --> 02:29:21,131
The airport is El Paso.

1204
02:29:21,215 --> 02:29:23,008
If you want someplace specific...

1205
02:29:23,092 --> 02:29:27,054
...you might could be better off just
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

1206
02:29:27,096 --> 02:29:29,306
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

1207
02:29:29,390 --> 02:29:32,268
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

1208
02:29:32,351 --> 02:29:35,229
What are you talking about?

1209
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:55,124
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

1210
02:29:55,207 --> 02:29:59,169
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

1211
02:29:59,253 --> 02:30:01,630
Yeah, that's me.

1212
02:30:01,714 --> 02:30:04,508
I got beers in my room.

1213
02:30:04,592 --> 02:30:08,471
- Oh, uh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

1214
02:30:08,555 --> 02:30:11,391
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

1215
02:30:11,474 --> 02:30:14,102
- Well, half.
- What else then?

1216
02:30:14,144 --> 02:30:18,982
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

1217
02:30:19,065 --> 02:30:21,776
But no one ever sees that.

1218
02:30:21,818 --> 02:30:25,155
Beer! That's what's comin'.

1219
02:30:25,197 --> 02:30:27,991
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

1220
02:30:28,074 --> 02:30:30,577
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

1221
02:30:32,412 --> 02:30:34,539
Beer leads to more beer.

1222
02:31:21,461 --> 02:31:22,921
You all right?

1223
02:31:28,218 --> 02:31:30,053
Call the police.

1224
02:31:35,892 --> 02:31:38,186
Your local law enforcement.

1225
02:31:39,521 --> 02:31:41,523
I'm not on their radio.

1226
02:31:41,565 --> 02:31:44,317
I met his daughter at the...

1227
02:32:31,782 --> 02:32:34,952
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

1228
02:32:35,036 --> 02:32:38,581
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

1229
02:32:38,664 --> 02:32:41,000
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

1230
02:32:41,083 --> 02:32:43,628
I suppose so.

1231
02:32:43,711 --> 02:32:45,880
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

1232
02:32:45,963 --> 02:32:51,135
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

1233
02:32:52,303 --> 02:32:54,972
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

1234
02:32:55,723 --> 02:32:58,976
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

1235
02:32:59,018 --> 02:33:02,104
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago.

1236
02:33:02,146 --> 02:33:05,274
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns.

1237
02:33:05,358 --> 02:33:08,486
...with green hair, bones in their noses...

1238
02:33:08,569 --> 02:33:11,113
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

1239
02:33:11,197 --> 02:33:12,782
Signs and wonders.

1240
02:33:12,823 --> 02:33:17,411
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

1241
02:33:17,495 --> 02:33:19,205
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

1242
02:33:19,288 --> 02:33:23,125
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

1243
02:33:23,167 --> 02:33:24,794
Not the one thing.

1244
02:33:24,835 --> 02:33:27,713
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

1245
02:33:27,797 --> 02:33:30,925
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

1246
02:33:31,008 --> 02:33:34,346
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

1247
02:33:34,429 --> 02:33:37,808
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

1248
02:33:37,849 --> 02:33:39,810
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

1249
02:33:39,851 --> 02:33:43,647
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

1250
02:33:43,689 --> 02:33:46,275
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

1251
02:33:46,358 --> 02:33:49,236
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

1252
02:33:50,445 --> 02:33:52,281
He shoots a desk clerk one day...

1253
02:33:52,364 --> 02:33:56,827
...walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

1254
02:33:56,910 --> 02:33:58,412
It's hard to believe.

1255
02:33:58,495 --> 02:34:01,748
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

1256
02:34:01,832 --> 02:34:07,212
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

1257
02:34:07,254 --> 02:34:10,257
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

1258
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:12,718
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

1259
02:37:44,848 --> 02:37:48,102
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

1260
02:37:48,143 --> 02:37:51,230
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

1261
02:37:51,313 --> 02:37:52,898
- You heard it?
- How's that?

1262
02:37:52,940 --> 02:37:57,152
Did you hear my?...
You're having fun with me.

1263
02:37:57,236 --> 02:38:01,615
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

1264
02:38:01,657 --> 02:38:06,453
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

1265
02:38:06,537 --> 02:38:08,706
How many of them things you got now?

1266
02:38:08,789 --> 02:38:11,292
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

1267
02:38:11,375 --> 02:38:14,670
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got. "

1268
02:38:14,753 --> 02:38:18,966
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

1269
02:38:22,052 --> 02:38:25,806
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

1270
02:38:27,141 --> 02:38:30,477
I got to say, you're looking older.

1271
02:38:30,519 --> 02:38:32,062
I am older.

1272
02:38:33,188 --> 02:38:35,649
Got a letter from your wife.

1273
02:38:35,733 --> 02:38:40,154
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

1274
02:38:40,237 --> 02:38:43,950
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

1275
02:38:46,995 --> 02:38:49,915
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

1276
02:38:57,422 --> 02:38:59,257
How fresh is that coffee?

1277
02:38:59,341 --> 02:39:05,055
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

1278
02:39:07,015 --> 02:39:09,351
That man that shot you died in prison?

1279
02:39:11,686 --> 02:39:13,939
Angola. Yeah.

1280
02:39:14,022 --> 02:39:16,816
What'd you done he'd a been released?

1281
02:39:16,858 --> 02:39:19,778
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

1282
02:39:19,861 --> 02:39:21,488
Wouldn't be no point in it.

1283
02:39:21,530 --> 02:39:24,824
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

1284
02:39:24,866 --> 02:39:28,620
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back.

1285
02:39:28,703 --> 02:39:32,332
...what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

1286
02:39:32,415 --> 02:39:35,377
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

1287
02:39:36,461 --> 02:39:40,590
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

1288
02:39:43,385 --> 02:39:47,430
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

1289
02:39:47,514 --> 02:39:49,808
I don't know.

1290
02:39:52,519 --> 02:39:54,187
I feel overmatched.

1291
02:39:58,733 --> 02:40:01,361
I always figured when I got older...

1292
02:40:01,403 --> 02:40:06,324
God would... Sort of
come into my life somehow.

1293
02:40:09,327 --> 02:40:10,370
And He didn't.

1294
02:40:14,249 --> 02:40:15,876
And I don't blame Him.

1295
02:40:18,253 --> 02:40:21,214
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

1296
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:23,634
You don't know what He thinks.

1297
02:40:37,857 --> 02:40:41,611
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers...

1298
02:40:41,652 --> 02:40:44,280
...put it in their museum.

1299
02:40:44,363 --> 02:40:47,992
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

1300
02:40:49,076 --> 02:40:52,622
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

1301
02:40:54,874 --> 02:40:59,754
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

1302
02:40:59,795 --> 02:41:02,798
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

1303
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:06,469
Well, they was ahead of him.

1304
02:41:06,552 --> 02:41:09,263
Shot him in his doorway.

1305
02:41:09,347 --> 02:41:11,933
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

1306
02:41:12,016 --> 02:41:15,978
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

1307
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:20,483
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

1308
02:41:21,567 --> 02:41:25,738
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

1309
02:41:26,656 --> 02:41:28,449
Left out.

1310
02:41:30,618 --> 02:41:34,121
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

1311
02:41:34,163 --> 02:41:37,291
Shot through the left lung.

1312
02:41:37,375 --> 02:41:41,921
And that was that... As they say.

1313
02:41:45,174 --> 02:41:46,509
When'd he die?

1314
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:51,138
Nineteen zero and, uh... Nine?

1315
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:55,017
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

1316
02:41:55,101 --> 02:41:58,813
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

1317
02:41:58,854 --> 02:42:03,901
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

1318
02:42:06,864 --> 02:42:09,616
What you got ain't nothin' new.

1319
02:42:10,742 --> 02:42:13,453
This country is hard on people.

1320
02:42:17,207 --> 02:42:19,334
You can't stop what's coming.

1321
02:42:21,128 --> 02:42:23,171
It ain't all waitin' on you.

1322
02:42:26,049 --> 02:42:27,885
That's vanity.

1323
02:43:28,820 --> 02:43:31,198
I knew this wasn't done with.

1324
02:43:34,034 --> 02:43:35,953
I ain't got the money.

1325
02:43:37,955 --> 02:43:42,209
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

1326
02:43:44,127 --> 02:43:48,675
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

1327
02:43:49,676 --> 02:43:51,553
I wouldn't worry about it.

1328
02:43:54,180 --> 02:43:55,765
I need to sit down.

1329
02:44:11,030 --> 02:44:13,116
You got no cause to hurt me.

1330
02:44:13,199 --> 02:44:17,036
No. But I gave my word.

1331
02:44:18,496 --> 02:44:22,125
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

1332
02:44:25,128 --> 02:44:27,881
That don't make sense.

1333
02:44:27,964 --> 02:44:31,175
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

1334
02:44:31,259 --> 02:44:34,762
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

1335
02:44:34,846 --> 02:44:37,682
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

1336
02:44:42,687 --> 02:44:44,689
Not like that.

1337
02:44:46,274 --> 02:44:48,109
Not like you say.

1338
02:44:54,199 --> 02:44:55,992
You don't have to do this.

1339
02:44:56,034 --> 02:44:58,328
People always say the same thing.

1340
02:45:00,038 --> 02:45:01,331
What do they say?

1341
02:45:02,415 --> 02:45:04,667
They say, "You don't have to do this. "

1342
02:45:05,835 --> 02:45:10,882
- You don't.
- OK.

1343
02:45:16,012 --> 02:45:18,014
This is the best I can do.

1344
02:45:19,098 --> 02:45:20,099
Call it.

1345
02:45:24,604 --> 02:45:28,191
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

1346
02:45:30,610 --> 02:45:33,239
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

1347
02:45:33,322 --> 02:45:37,660
- Call it.
- No.

1348
02:45:37,743 --> 02:45:40,246
I ain't gonna call it.

1349
02:45:43,624 --> 02:45:45,042
Call it.

1350
02:45:45,084 --> 02:45:48,170
The coin don't have no say.

1351
02:45:48,254 --> 02:45:50,089
It's just you.

1352
02:45:52,633 --> 02:45:55,719
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

1353
02:47:38,365 --> 02:47:41,493
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

1354
02:47:41,576 --> 02:47:43,995
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

1355
02:47:44,037 --> 02:47:46,998
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

1356
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:49,376
All right.

1357
02:47:49,417 --> 02:47:53,255
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

1358
02:47:54,548 --> 02:47:56,508
What'll you take for the shirt?

1359
02:48:01,054 --> 02:48:04,057
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

1360
02:48:11,064 --> 02:48:14,526
Look at that fucking bone.

1361
02:48:14,568 --> 02:48:15,735
Tie this for me.

1362
02:48:16,862 --> 02:48:18,822
Just tie it, just tie it.

1363
02:48:36,840 --> 02:48:40,886
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

1364
02:48:40,927 --> 02:48:43,430
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

1365
02:48:43,513 --> 02:48:46,641
Take it and... You didn't see me.

1366
02:48:46,725 --> 02:48:48,977
I was already gone.

1367
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:50,353
Yes, sir.

1368
02:48:54,774 --> 02:48:58,279
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

1369
02:48:58,362 --> 02:49:02,783
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

1370
02:49:22,887 --> 02:49:25,514
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

1371
02:49:25,598 --> 02:49:29,477
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

1372
02:49:30,728 --> 02:49:34,273
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

1373
02:49:36,317 --> 02:49:40,696
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Uh... Better not.

1374
02:49:44,992 --> 02:49:48,329
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

1375
02:49:48,412 --> 02:49:52,792
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

1376
02:49:52,833 --> 02:49:55,670
They always is to the party concerned.

1377
02:49:57,922 --> 02:50:00,508
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

1378
02:50:02,969 --> 02:50:08,057
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

1379
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:11,143
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

1380
02:50:11,185 --> 02:50:15,064
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

1381
02:50:15,147 --> 02:50:18,234
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well...

1382
02:50:18,317 --> 02:50:21,028
...but it was about meeting him in town...

1383
02:50:21,112 --> 02:50:23,698
...somewheres,
and he give me some money.

1384
02:50:23,781 --> 02:50:25,408
I think I lost it.

1385
02:50:27,201 --> 02:50:32,123
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

1386
02:50:32,206 --> 02:50:36,294
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

1387
02:50:36,377 --> 02:50:39,798
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

1388
02:50:39,882 --> 02:50:43,260
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

1389
02:50:43,343 --> 02:50:45,804
And he rode past me and kept on going...

1390
02:50:45,888 --> 02:50:48,640
...never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

1391
02:50:50,267 --> 02:50:54,062
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

1392
02:50:55,898 --> 02:50:59,860
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn...

1393
02:50:59,943 --> 02:51:01,862
...the way people used to do, and I...

1394
02:51:01,904 --> 02:51:04,531
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it...

1395
02:51:04,573 --> 02:51:06,325
'bout the color of the moon.

1396
02:51:07,826 --> 02:51:10,162
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

1397
02:51:11,038 --> 02:51:12,831
...going on ahead.

1398
02:51:13,415 --> 02:51:18,295
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

1399
02:51:21,924 --> 02:51:24,885
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

1400
02:51:29,431 --> 02:51:31,433
And then I woke up.

1401
02:51:32,305 --> 02:51:38,812
