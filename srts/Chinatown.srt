1
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,739
All right, Curly, enough's enough.

2
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:41,494
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

3
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,345
Down the hatch.

4
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,485
- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.

5
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,237
When you're right, you're right.

6
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,030
And you're right.

7
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,117
I'll pay you the rest next week.

8
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,078
We only caught 60 ton of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

9
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,373
And they don't pay you the same
for skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.

10
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,708
Forget it, will you, Curly?

11
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,128
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

12
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,463
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

13
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,966
- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.

14
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,510
Careful driving home, Curl, huh?

15
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:44,265
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

16
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,060
Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?

17
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,981
- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.

18
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,526
Now, what seems to be the problem?

19
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,820
My husband,

20
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,573
I believe, is seeing another woman.

21
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,536
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.

22
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,288
I am sorry.

23
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,375
Mr. Gittes, please, do you think
we could discuss this alone?

24
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,589
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives,

25
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,967
and at some point,
they're going to have to assist me.

26
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,470
I can't do everything myself.

27
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,930
Of course not.

28
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,348
Now,

29
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,188
what makes you certain
that your husband is

30
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,899
involved with someone?

31
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,692
A wife can tell.

32
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,364
Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?

33
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,699
Yes, of course!

34
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,202
- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, I...

35
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,454
I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.

36
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,458
Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?

37
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,003
You're better off not knowing.

38
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,755
I have to know.

39
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,053
Very well.

40
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,890
What is your husband's first name?

41
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,141
Hollis.

42
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,893
Hollis Mulwray.

43
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,064
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.

44
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,275
Chief Engineer?

45
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,493
Mrs. Mulwray, this...

46
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:32,039
This type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook.

47
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,291
It takes time...

48
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,211
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.

49
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,591
Okay, we'll...

50
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,636
We'll see what we can do.

51
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,305
Gentlemen, today
you can walk out that door,

52
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,475
turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,

53
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,103
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

54
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,898
Now, you can swim in it and you can
fish in it, but you can't drink it,

55
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,277
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

56
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,155
Now remember,
we live next door to the ocean,

57
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,158
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

58
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,869
Los Angeles is a desert community.

59
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,581
Beneath this building,
beneath our streets, is a desert.

60
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,667
And without water,
the dust will rise up and cover us

61
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,169
as though we never existed.

62
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,464
Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,

63
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,426
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

64
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,513
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets

65
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,639
and not on top of them.

66
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,932
Hear, hear!

67
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,483
Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments again.

68
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,819
I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.

69
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,154
Mr. Mulwray?

70
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,626
In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,

71
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,379
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

72
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,468
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

73
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:12,181
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

74
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:15,267
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

75
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:18,979
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam

76
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,358
with slopes of 2.5: 1, 112 feet high,

77
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,944
and a 12,000-acre water surface.

78
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,363
Well, it won't hold.

79
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,574
I won't build it. It's that simple.

80
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,452
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

81
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,412
Thank you, gentlemen.

82
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,546
Quiet! Quiet!

83
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,969
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!

84
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,429
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!

85
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:56,100
You don't have an answer for that
so quick, do you?

86
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,854
You steal water from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,

87
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,690
starve the livestock!

88
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,151
Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?

89
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,111
That's what I want to know!

90
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,692
- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.

91
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,196
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

92
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,871
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,

93
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,541
a men's room at a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.

94
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,210
The guy's got water on the brain.

95
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,183
So what do you got?

96
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,331
This?

97
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,668
Well, they got into a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.

98
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,755
What about?

99
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,257
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud.

100
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,259
I heard only one thing, though.

101
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,594
"Apple core."

102
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,722
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.

103
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,937
My God, Walsh, is that
what you spent your day doing?

104
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,440
Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.

105
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,193
Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.

106
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,694
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

107
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,198
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

108
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,452
What is it, Sophie?

109
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,454
Duffy's on the phone.

110
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,794
- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!

111
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,630
He's found himself
some cute little twist, the old buzzard...

112
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,215
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?

113
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,050
I'm at Glendale and Douglas.

114
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,970
They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!

115
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,429
Okay.

116
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,725
Echo Park.

117
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,018
Water again.

118
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,577
Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.

119
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,752
You'll love it.

120
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,262
Here. Let me...

121
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,570
When you get so much publicity,
you got to get blasé about it.

122
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,199
Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically a movie star.

123
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,082
- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.

124
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,583
Sure is.

125
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,044
Fools' names and fools' faces.

126
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,175
- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.

127
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,844
You got a hell of a way to make a living.

128
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:56,264
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

129
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,267
Mortgage department,
First National Bank.

130
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,522
Tell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?

131
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,024
We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.

132
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,609
Neither do I.

133
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,195
No, you have your press agent do it.

134
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,532
Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?

135
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,367
Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.

136
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,452
People only come to me
when they're in a desperate situation.

137
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,788
I help them out.
I don't kick families out of their houses

138
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,791
- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...

139
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,710
Maybe you'd like to step down
out of the barber chair

140
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,294
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

141
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,462
- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.

142
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,880
Jake, let me tell you about the guy
who got tired...

143
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,049
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

144
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,301
It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.

145
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,470
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!

146
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,055
Of course you do.

147
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,474
Anyway, this guy
who got tired of screwing his wife

148
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,977
- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?

149
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,979
So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"

150
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,647
He says, "What do the Chinese do?"

151
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,816
He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."

152
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,403
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

153
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,157
Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?

154
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,951
- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...

155
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,579
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

156
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,747
- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.

157
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,165
I want to tell you a story.

158
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,333
So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?

159
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,252
He's tired of screwing his wife.

160
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,920
- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.

161
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,589
You're always in such a hurry.

162
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,340
So his friend says to him,

163
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,593
"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"

164
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,595
So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"

165
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,347
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,

166
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,100
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

167
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:25,103
"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,

168
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,022
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

169
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,441
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.

170
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,026
I mean, you'll love this.

171
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,279
Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,

172
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,782
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

173
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,201
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

174
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,205
So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.

175
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,707
So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.

176
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,543
He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.

177
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,712
Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,

178
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,297
and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"

179
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,132
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

180
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,551
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.

181
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,637
He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,

182
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,722
he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,

183
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,641
she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?

184
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,560
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

185
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,480
Jesus!

186
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,315
That Barney!

187
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,030
Mr. Gittes?

188
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,033
Yes.

189
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,410
Do you know me?

190
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,663
Well,

191
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,500
I think I would have remembered.

192
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,585
Have we ever met?

193
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,506
Well, no.

194
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,924
Never?

195
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,259
Never.

196
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,094
That's what I thought.

197
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,263
You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

198
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,682
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?

199
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,353
Not that Mulwray?

200
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,106
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.

201
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,443
And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,

202
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,864
you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,

203
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,366
certainly not spy on my husband.

204
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,244
I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.

205
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,706
Well, you're going to get it.

206
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,875
Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.

207
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,043
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

208
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,795
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

209
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,882
I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.

210
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,633
My lawyer does.

211
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,971
Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

212
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,477
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

213
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,245
- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...

214
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,998
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

215
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,417
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

216
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,002
Since lunch.

217
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,672
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?

218
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,343
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

219
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,803
Sir?

220
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,559
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

221
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,687
Is he still in the building?

222
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,315
Very well. Thank you.

223
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,026
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

224
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,652
J.J. Gittes.

225
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,363
It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.

226
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,699
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

227
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,950
Certainly.

228
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,078
We're a bit nervous around here

229
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,081
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

230
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,916
Right this way.

231
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:07,135
You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,

232
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,804
you come to know his habits, his values.

233
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,972
You come to know him.

234
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,267
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

235
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,727
And Mulwray isn't?

236
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,146
He never even kids about it.

237
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,316
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.

238
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,404
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

239
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,698
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

240
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,825
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

241
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,828
Well, tell him I'll be back.

242
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,164
I will.

243
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,458
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

244
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,418
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

245
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,879
- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.

246
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,719
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

247
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,138
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

248
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:55,517
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

249
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:58,144
You don't take a bath in it.

250
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,979
They wrote you a letter!

251
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,024
But then you'd have to be able to read.

252
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,404
Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?

253
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,116
Well, I hope so. He's working for us.

254
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,325
Doing what?

255
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,910
Well, frankly, there have been
some threats

256
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,787
to blow up the city reservoirs.

257
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,456
- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.

258
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,209
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

259
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,795
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

260
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,548
- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?

261
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,217
When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,

262
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:32,679
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tons of booze on the beach

263
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,265
and never lost a drop.

264
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,726
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

265
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,289
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

266
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,481
Please.

267
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,706
You wait.

268
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,438
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

269
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,733
Bad for the glass.

270
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,437
Mr. Gittes.

271
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:13,066
Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

272
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,445
Would you like something to drink?

273
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:18,738
What are you having?

274
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,616
- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

275
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,952
- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

276
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,247
My husband's at the office.

277
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:32,126
Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,

278
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,754
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

279
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,673
That's not his apartment.

280
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,593
Anyway, I...

281
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,348
The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,

282
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,850
and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,

283
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,060
set me up.

284
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,396
L.A.'s a small town. People talk.

285
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,982
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

286
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:58,569
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.

287
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,822
- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.

288
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,032
So let's just drop the whole thing.

289
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,867
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.

290
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,786
- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?

291
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,038
...I don't want to drop it.

292
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,376
I better talk to your husband about this.

293
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,962
Why? What on Earth for?

294
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,172
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

295
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,009
Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,

296
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,219
but never that.

297
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,263
Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,

298
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,682
and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.

299
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:31,060
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

300
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,604
So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.

301
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,648
Why should it be a problem?

302
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:40,027
- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

303
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,364
Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,

304
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,741
in a cheap sort of a way, of course.

305
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:49,162
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

306
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,206
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

307
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,460
- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!

308
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,879
It couldn't be more personal.

309
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,591
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

310
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,634
Let's look at it this way.

311
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:07,346
Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,

312
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,932
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

313
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,226
Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.

314
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,478
They're out to get your husband.

315
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,063
If I can see him, I can help him.

316
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,736
Did you talk to him this morning?

317
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:23,488
No.

318
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,948
I went riding rather early.

319
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,576
Looks like you went quite a distance.

320
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,620
I was riding bareback.

321
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,414
You...

322
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,792
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

323
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,711
Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.

324
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,338
Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.

325
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,131
I'll stop by.

326
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,008
Please call first.

327
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,610
Sorry, closed to public, sir.

328
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,613
Oh, that's all right, Officer.

329
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,117
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

330
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,829
- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.

331
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,857
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

332
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,151
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

333
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,571
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

334
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,657
Hello, Jake.

335
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,326
Lou. How are you?

336
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:58,207
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.

337
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,461
- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.

338
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,005
There's no smoking here, sir...

339
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,966
That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.

340
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,344
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

341
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,096
Thanks, Lou.

342
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,515
How'd you get past the guard?

343
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,102
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.

344
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,189
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

345
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,316
I get by.

346
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,819
Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.

347
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,112
Maybe you have.

348
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,282
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

349
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:35,244
Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail

350
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,622
for spitting in the laundry?

351
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,625
You're a little behind the times, Jake.

352
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,793
They use steam irons now.

353
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,087
And I'm out of Chinatown.

354
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,214
Since when?

355
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,717
Since I made lieutenant.

356
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,053
Congratulations.

357
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,016
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

358
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,267
Who?

359
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,145
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

360
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,897
Yeah.

361
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,566
I'd like to talk to him.

362
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,402
So you'd like to talk to him, huh?

363
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,906
You're welcome to try.

364
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,742
There he is.

365
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:36,430
Looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

366
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,809
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

367
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,689
Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.

368
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,983
Mrs. Mulwray,

369
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,321
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

370
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,866
The publicity didn't make him

371
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,786
morose, or unhappy?

372
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,289
It didn't make him happy.

373
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,209
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

374
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,460
No.

375
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,131
Mrs. Mulwray,

376
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:14,301
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

377
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:16,721
No.

378
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,140
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

379
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,143
You and your husband
never discussed her?

380
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,020
He...

381
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,231
We did.

382
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,151
He wouldn't tell me her name.

383
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,905
We quarreled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.

384
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,991
A complete surprise?

385
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,660
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

386
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,872
A private investigator?

387
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:45,249
Mr. Gittes.

388
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,550
Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end

389
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,511
to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.

390
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,183
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

391
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,852
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

392
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,189
Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.

393
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,609
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

394
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,860
No.

395
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,613
- Or her name?
- No.

396
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,698
Of course not.

397
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,992
Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?

398
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,286
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.

399
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,873
If we need anymore information,
we'll be in touch.

400
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,251
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

401
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,464
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

402
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,553
- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- Take it easy, guys. Let us get through.

403
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,013
We better do this in a hurry.

404
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,433
Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!

405
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,312
You want a picture, guys? Here it is!

406
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,397
"Gittes", two T's and an E.

407
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,985
Thank you for
going along with me back there.

408
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,280
I just didn't want to explain anything.

409
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,616
I'll send you a check.

410
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,784
A check?

411
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,787
To make it official that I've hired you.

412
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,514
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

413
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,933
Jake, what are you doing here?

414
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,560
Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.

415
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,396
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped dead lately.

416
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,314
Yeah? Isn't this something?

417
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,484
Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner drowns.

418
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,112
- Only in L.A.
- Yeah.

419
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,657
- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.

420
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,206
So how are you doing, Morty?

421
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,085
Never better, except for this darn cough.

422
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,462
- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.

423
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,222
Who you got there?

424
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:08,309
Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.

425
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,729
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

426
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,024
Quite a character.

427
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,069
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

428
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,741
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

429
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,910
All right, there.

430
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,501
Yeah. He drowned, too.

431
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,921
Come again?

432
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,633
Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.

433
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,259
The L.A. River?

434
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,013
Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?

435
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,307
Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.

436
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,768
It's not completely dry.

437
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,646
Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,

438
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,814
no matter how soused he is.

439
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,567
We got water out of him. He drowned!

440
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,918
Hello.

441
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,677
Howdy.

442
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,472
You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?

443
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,809
Do you speak English?

444
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,443
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

445
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:23,944
Yes.

446
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,614
What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?

447
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,409
- The water.
- What about the water?

448
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,870
- When it comes.
- When it comes?

449
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,497
What did you tell him?

450
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,167
It comes in different parts of the river.

451
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,544
Every night a different part.

452
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,772
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

453
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,992
Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!

454
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,126
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?

455
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,967
You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?

456
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,844
You know what happens
to nosy fellows?

457
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,848
No? Want to guess? No?

458
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,142
Okay. They lose their noses.

459
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:49,650
Next time you lose the whole thing.

460
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,527
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

461
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,030
Understand?

462
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,491
- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?

463
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,284
I understand.

464
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:00,827
All right.

465
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,882
So some contractor
wants to build a dam,

466
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,468
and he makes a few payoffs. So what?

467
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:20,097
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.

468
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,807
Don't want Mulvihill.

469
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,768
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

470
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,228
Then what do you do?

471
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,980
Sue the shit out of them.

472
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,564
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

473
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,195
- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.

474
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,864
- Who?
- Ida Sessions.

475
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,910
Don't know her. Take a number.

476
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,704
Sue people like that,

477
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:48,125
they're liable to be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

478
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,670
I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.

479
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,714
She says you know her.

480
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:55,590
Okay.

481
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:03,265
Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

482
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,267
Oh, yes, we have.

483
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:07,728
- Are you alone?
- Isn't everyone?

484
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,647
What can I do for you?

485
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,192
Well, I'm a working girl.

486
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,611
I didn't come in to see you on my own.

487
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,488
When did you come in?

488
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:22,159
I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?

489
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:24,911
- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?

490
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,457
- Yes, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?

491
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,753
No. I was just checking a detail
or two with my two associates.

492
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:33,962
Go on.

493
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,549
I never expected anything to happen
like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.

494
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,177
The point is, if it ever comes out,

495
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,263
I want somebody to know
that I didn't know what would happen.

496
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,890
I understand.

497
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,560
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.

498
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,187
Oh, no! Oh, no.

499
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,897
No.

500
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,692
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

501
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:56,860
No, Mr. Gittes.

502
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,030
Just look in the obituary column
oftoday's L.A. Post-Record.

503
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,698
The obituary column?

504
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:05,577
- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...

505
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,747
Sure.

506
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,541
How do you like them apples?

507
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,533
Ma'am.

508
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,831
Thank you for coming.

509
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,340
- Yes, sir?
- Drink?

510
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,552
Tom Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.

511
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,637
Tom Collins with lime.

512
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,435
I got your check in the mail.

513
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,771
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

514
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:19,109
Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

515
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,656
How much would you like?

516
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,826
Oh, stop it, the money's fine.
It's generous.

517
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:32,914
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

518
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,001
- I have?
- I think so.

519
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,296
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

520
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,798
You were upset, but not that upset.

521
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:44,926
Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.

522
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:49,806
Sorry.

523
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:55,854
Look, you sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,

524
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,316
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

525
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,067
Excuse me.

526
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,573
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- It wasn't much of a lie.

527
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,159
If your husband was killed, it was.

528
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,829
This could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence.

529
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,831
But he wasn't killed.

530
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,378
Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.

531
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:26,760
Well,

532
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,180
I suppose I am.

533
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,017
Actually, I knew about the affair.

534
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,938
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

535
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,523
He told you?

536
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,692
And you weren't the least bit upset?

537
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,611
I was grateful.

538
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,782
Mrs. Mulwray, you'll have to explain that.

539
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,033
Why?

540
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,119
Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my métier.

541
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:56,164
When a wife tells me that she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her,

542
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,833
it runs contrary to my experience.

543
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,919
Unless what?

544
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,632
She was cheating on him.

545
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:09,678
Were you?

546
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,977
I dislike the word "cheat".

547
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:19,688
Did you have affairs?

548
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,482
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?

549
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,820
Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him
every time I went to bed with someone,

550
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,989
if that's what you mean.

551
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,741
Is there anything else you want
to know about me?

552
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,869
Where were you
when your husband died?

553
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,913
I can't tell you.

554
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,582
You mean you don't know
where you were?

555
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:42,002
- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.

556
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,505
For very long?

557
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,717
I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.

558
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,177
It's difficult for me.

559
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,059
Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.

560
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,729
I didn't want publicity.

561
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:04,149
I didn't want to go
into any of this, then or now.

562
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,234
Is that all?

563
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,992
By the way,
what does this "C" stand for?

564
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,370
"Cross."

565
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,292
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.

566
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:23,918
Why?

567
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,046
No reason.

568
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,465
You must've had a reason
to ask me that.

569
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:30,425
No. I'm just a snoop.

570
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:39,684
No. I have my own car. The Packard.

571
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:41,686
Wait a minute, sonny.

572
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,938
I think you better come with me.

573
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:46,274
But why? There's nothing more to say.

574
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:48,652
Will you get my car, please?

575
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,697
Okay, go home.

576
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:56,576
But in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.

577
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,953
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tons of water

578
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,205
from the city's reservoirs,

579
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,666
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

580
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,460
He found out about it, and he was killed.

581
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,420
There's a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue.

582
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,006
Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to take the trouble,

583
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,174
which they don't.

584
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,510
It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,

585
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,470
which is fine by me.

586
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,306
But, Mrs. Mulwray,

587
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,725
I goddamn near lost my nose,

588
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,102
and I like it.

589
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,104
I like breathing through it.

590
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,399
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

591
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,867
Mr. Gittes...

592
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,463
J.J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

593
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,538
Mr. Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

594
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,333
Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.

595
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,587
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

596
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,339
I take a long lunch hour.

597
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,343
All day, sometimes.

598
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:39,781
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

599
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,199
Yes.

600
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,576
- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?

601
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,662
He owned it.

602
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,415
He owned the Water Department?

603
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,667
Yes.

604
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,005
You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?

605
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,257
Yes.

606
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,056
How did they get it away from him?

607
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,601
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

608
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,478
Mr. Mulwray?

609
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,189
I thought you said Cross owned it.

610
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,275
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

611
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,280
- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.

612
00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:00,695
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

613
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,494
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.

614
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,789
These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.

615
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:16,127
Yeah. Must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances.

616
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:20,256
Yes. Hollis was the best
department chief the city's ever had.

617
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,301
My goodness,
what happened to your nose?

618
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,219
Cut myself shaving.

619
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:29,390
Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.

620
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,351
Only when I breathe.

621
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,523
Only when you breathe.

622
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,194
Don't tell me you're still working
for Mrs. Mulwray.

623
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,696
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

624
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,616
Neither do I, actually.

625
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,242
You hired me.

626
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,621
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

627
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,375
Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.

628
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,628
Well, let's look at it this way.

629
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,922
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

630
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,257
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

631
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,176
You decided to ruin it.

632
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,638
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

633
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,890
Then he was...

634
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,558
Drowned.

635
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:16,312
Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.

636
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:18,731
I don't know what you're talking about.

637
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:22,652
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.

638
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,321
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet

639
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:28,282
in the middle of a drought, that's news.

640
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,744
Mr. Gittes,

641
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,080
we're...

642
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,668
We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water

643
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,754
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

644
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,549
As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,

645
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,259
but we've been trying to help
some of them out,

646
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,302
keep them from going under.

647
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:52,140
Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

648
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,350
Yeah. A little run-off.

649
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:58,855
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- In the Northwest Valley.

650
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:01,774
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

651
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:06,654
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.

652
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,824
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.

653
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,952
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

654
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:14,954
Yes.

655
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:17,165
I don't want to nail you.

656
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,839
I want to find out who put you up to it.

657
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,216
I'll give you a few days to think about it.

658
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,177
Call me. I can help.

659
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:30,970
Who knows?

660
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,640
Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,

661
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,350
and you can stay
the head of the department

662
00:56:36,477 --> 00:56:38,352
for the next 20 years.

663
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,438
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

664
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:29,904
What is your usual salary?

665
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:34,784
$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,

666
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,036
plus expenses,

667
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,373
plus a bonus if I show results.

668
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,463
Whoever is behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this trouble?

669
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,798
Money.

670
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,218
How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,

671
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,053
that I don't know.

672
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,222
I'll pay your salary,

673
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,974
plus $5,000

674
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:02,395
if you find out what happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.

675
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,903
Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.

676
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,738
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

677
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:18,619
Tell me something.

678
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,706
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father

679
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,958
sold the Water Department?

680
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,003
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?

681
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,299
Yes, of course.

682
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,843
It was sometime after.

683
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:38,139
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

684
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,102
Then you married
your father's business partner.

685
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:48,816
You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.

686
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:54,488
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

687
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,948
Why, no.

688
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,743
Yes. A little.

689
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,953
You see, Hollis and my...

690
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,623
My father

691
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,334
had a falling-out finally.

692
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,671
Over you
or over the Water Department?

693
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,965
Not over me. Why should it be over me?

694
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,717
Then it was over
the Water Department.

695
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,843
Yes.

696
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,513
Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,

697
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,392
and I don't think my father felt that way.

698
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,687
Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.

699
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,105
You know, the dam that broke?

700
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,567
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.

701
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:35,905
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

702
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,658
They never spoke from that time on.

703
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,497
You sure about that?

704
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:47,208
Of course I'm sure.

705
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,381
Sign here.

706
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,676
The copy's for you.

707
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:01,240
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.

708
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,784
How do you do?

709
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:08,122
You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gitts.
I like that.

710
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,082
Thanks.

711
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,084
If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,

712
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,295
but in your business, it's admirable.

713
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,339
And it's good advertising.

714
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:17,506
It doesn't hurt.

715
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,926
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

716
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:22,845
Probably.

717
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,805
But I'm surprised
you're still working for her,

718
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,391
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

719
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:31,604
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

720
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,608
How'd she get that idea?

721
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,277
I think I gave it to her.

722
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:43,324
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

723
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,702
Fine. Long as you don't serve
chicken that way.

724
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:51,999
Tell me, what do the police say?

725
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,460
They're calling it an accident.

726
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,590
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.

727
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,301
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.

728
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:04,220
Where from?

729
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,807
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

730
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,186
Would you call him a capable man?

731
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,188
Very.

732
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,981
Honest?

733
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,733
As far as it goes.

734
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,695
Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.

735
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:25,408
Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

736
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,827
- None.
- That's too bad.

737
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,162
Too bad?

738
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:34,500
It disturbs me. Makes me think
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

739
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,044
Financially speaking, of course.

740
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,089
What are you charging her?

741
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:45,886
My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.

742
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,097
Are you sleeping with her?

743
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,684
Come, come, Mr. Gitts.

744
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,521
You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?

745
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,358
If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,

746
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:02,069
I'll put one of my men on the job.

747
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,448
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...

748
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,241
- Gittes.
- Gittes.

749
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,245
You're dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

750
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,789
I don't want her taken advantage of.

751
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:15,749
- Sit down.
- What for?

752
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,839
You may think you know
what you're dealing with,

753
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:24,091
but believe me, you don't.

754
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,802
Why is that funny?

755
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:30,055
It's what the District Attorney
used to tell me in Chinatown.

756
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,974
Yeah? Was he right?

757
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,312
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

758
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,777
Mainly that you're rich,

759
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:47,490
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

760
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:50,242
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

761
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,704
Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores

762
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,916
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

763
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,753
I'll double whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000

764
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,255
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

765
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:06,509
- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?

766
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,801
Yeah.

767
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,055
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

768
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,431
Maybe.

769
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:15,184
If Mulwray was murdered,

770
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,521
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

771
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:21,524
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

772
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:25,236
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

773
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,323
who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's re-election.

774
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,326
I let them practice up out here.

775
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,662
Yeah.

776
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:39,291
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

777
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:41,961
At my age, you tend to forget.

778
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:46,048
It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle,

779
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,884
and you had one hell of an argument.

780
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:52,972
I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.

781
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:59,061
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.

782
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,523
What about her?

783
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:06,902
Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.

784
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,993
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

785
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,996
I'd like to help her if I can.

786
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,000
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

787
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,211
Hollis Mulwray made this city,

788
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,006
and he made me a fortune.

789
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:31,885
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

790
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:39,351
If you want to hire me, I still have to
know what the argument was about.

791
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,813
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

792
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,025
I didn't want her to find out
about the girl.

793
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:48,068
How did you find out?

794
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:52,448
I still got a few teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.

795
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,535
Okay.

796
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,538
I'll...

797
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,917
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

798
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:05,878
Tell me,

799
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:11,091
are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

800
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,052
Just find the girl.

801
01:06:14,554 --> 01:06:16,263
I'll look into it,

802
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:19,558
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

803
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,061
Orange groves?

804
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,397
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

805
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:32,613
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could tell me

806
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:35,449
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

807
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,368
Part of it's in Ventura County.

808
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:40,913
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

809
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,583
Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

810
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,169
Row 23, section C.

811
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:52,925
Weasel.

812
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:49,815
Say, sonny,

813
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:55,654
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

814
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:59,241
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

815
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,494
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

816
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:07,166
Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.

817
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,251
If that's what it says.

818
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,547
Can I check one of these volumes out?

819
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:18,552
Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.

820
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,597
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

821
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,851
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

822
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,562
I'd like to be able to read across.

823
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,075
Why, thank you.

824
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:51,019
Hold it right there!

825
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,840
All right, quit it. Quit, now!

826
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:04,509
Search the man. See if he's armed.

827
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,734
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

828
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:23,153
Search him. Search him!

829
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,073
He ain't armed.

830
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:27,658
All right, mister, who you with,

831
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:30,911
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

832
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,246
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

833
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:34,748
You come near me
with that thing again,

834
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:35,916
you're gonna need a pair of them!

835
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,834
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

836
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,880
I said cut that out! Give the man
a chance to say something!

837
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:49,221
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

838
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,056
I'm not with either one of them.

839
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,601
Then what you doing out here, mister?

840
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,937
A client hired me to see...

841
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,774
To see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

842
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,567
Irrigating my land?

843
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:04,277
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

844
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:07,114
to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.

845
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,324
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

846
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:12,202
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

847
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,667
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

848
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:21,753
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

849
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:26,425
Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.

850
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,267
Well, that's that.

851
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,671
What's going on?

852
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,757
You didn't look too good,

853
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,843
so we thought we better call
your employer.

854
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:16,141
Thanks for coming.

855
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:23,398
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

856
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:27,235
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L.A. Into building it.

857
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,072
But the water's not gonna go to L.A.,
it's coming right here.

858
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,364
To the Valley?

859
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,909
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

860
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,536
I was at the Hall of Records today.

861
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:46,505
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,

862
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:50,300
Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,

863
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:53,595
and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.

864
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,680
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

865
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:59,518
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

866
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,436
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

867
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:02,979
and then picking it up for peanuts.

868
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:07,651
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

869
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,737
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

870
01:14:12,532 --> 01:14:15,909
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

871
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:22,541
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

872
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,753
- We got it!
- What?

873
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,421
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

874
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,550
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista Inn today

875
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:32,759
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

876
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,262
He passed away two weeks ago.

877
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,931
Why is that unusual?

878
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:42,102
He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.

879
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,854
That's unusual.

880
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:30,984
Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?

881
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,278
Yes, I hope so.

882
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:35,947
It's Dad.

883
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:38,074
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

884
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,493
- Can I, sweetheart?
- My goodness.

885
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,121
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

886
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:45,790
Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.

887
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:48,960
- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.

888
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,922
Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,

889
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:53,798
and money is no object.

890
01:15:53,925 --> 01:15:56,635
Perhaps if we met with your father.

891
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:59,971
- There is one question.
- Of course.

892
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:03,266
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

893
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,852
I'm sorry, but we don't.

894
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,604
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

895
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:10,649
We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?

896
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:15,070
Would it be possible for me to see
a list of your patients, just to be certain?

897
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:19,282
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

898
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,493
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

899
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:24,829
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

900
01:16:24,956 --> 01:16:26,039
Good.

901
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,500
I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?

902
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:29,876
No. Allow me to show you.

903
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,587
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

904
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:35,090
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

905
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,925
It's almost bedtime.

906
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:40,303
We understand. Come, my sweet.

907
01:16:52,692 --> 01:16:55,277
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

908
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,362
Sit down. Have a chair.

909
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:20,218
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

910
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:29,811
You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.

911
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,438
They can't be.

912
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:38,570
They may not know it, but they are.

913
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:41,948
- Hello, girls.
- Hello.

914
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,576
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

915
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:48,872
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

916
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:51,541
Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

917
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:52,667
Why?

918
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,961
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

919
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:56,880
Oh, I'm not.

920
01:17:56,964 --> 01:18:01,092
- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.

921
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,094
Some time ago,

922
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:07,223
my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,

923
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:08,933
but we lost it.

924
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,936
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

925
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,606
Where did you get
this piece of material?

926
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,608
At the Abbacore Club.

927
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,528
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

928
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:22,572
It's a fish.

929
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:27,369
My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.

930
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,371
How do they do that?

931
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:33,625
Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...

932
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,168
But what?

933
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:38,630
We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.

934
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:43,843
Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.

935
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:47,597
Goodbye, ladies.

936
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:48,765
- Bye!
- Bye!

937
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,984
Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.

938
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:02,278
Can we leave the lady out of this?

939
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,573
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

940
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,451
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

941
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,787
Get in the car.

942
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,119
Maid's night off?

943
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:37,040
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

944
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:41,085
- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.

945
01:20:41,921 --> 01:20:44,130
Easy. It's an innocent question.

946
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:47,300
No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

947
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,302
I guess you're right.

948
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,265
To you, Mrs. Mulwray.

949
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:58,102
Frankly, tonight, you saved my...

950
01:20:58,395 --> 01:21:00,230
You saved my neck.

951
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,151
Tell me, Mr. Gittes,

952
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,905
does this often happen to you?

953
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,950
What's that?

954
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:15,620
Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,

955
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:17,914
but if this is how you go
about your work,

956
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:21,793
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

957
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,256
Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.

958
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,341
When was the last time?

959
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:30,093
Why?

960
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:32,971
It's an innocent question.

961
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,979
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

962
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:46,776
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

963
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,611
As little as possible.

964
01:21:48,696 --> 01:21:52,198
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

965
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,993
They do in Chinatown.

966
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,705
Why did you leave the police force?

967
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:07,797
Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?

968
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,508
Surely. Will you come this way?

969
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,569
My God!

970
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:34,741
It's a nasty cut.

971
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,411
I had no idea...

972
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,709
Sorry!

973
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,170
There.

974
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,756
Is it painful?

975
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,053
It must be painful.

976
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,556
What's wrong?

977
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,725
Your eye.

978
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,772
What about it? What?

979
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,942
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

980
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:11,861
Oh, that.

981
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:16,699
It's a flaw in the iris.

982
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:20,119
- A flaw?
- Yes.

983
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:23,581
A sort of birthmark.

984
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:01,327
Did you wear a uniform?

985
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,455
Sometimes.

986
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,793
Must have looked cute in blue.

987
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,839
Give me a break, will you?

988
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,091
I don't know you.

989
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,761
I want to know more about you.

990
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,638
Not now.

991
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:26,352
You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?

992
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:30,273
I'm tired.

993
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:34,110
No. Why does it bother you
to talk about it?

994
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:37,947
- It bothers everybody that works there.
- Where?

995
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:40,825
Chinatown. Everybody.

996
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:44,495
To me, it was just bad luck.

997
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:45,955
Why?

998
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,544
You can't always tell what's going on.

999
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,214
Like with you.

1000
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:06,184
Why was...

1001
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,354
Why was it bad luck?

1002
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:18,237
I was trying to keep someone
from being hurt.

1003
01:25:18,864 --> 01:25:21,824
I ended up making sure
that she was hurt.

1004
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,668
Was there a woman involved?

1005
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:35,838
Of course.

1006
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:38,591
Dead?

1007
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:53,356
Yes, hello?

1008
01:25:56,235 --> 01:26:00,029
Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.

1009
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:02,740
Don't do anything until I get there.

1010
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:09,622
I have to go.

1011
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:13,960
- Where?
- Just that I have to.

1012
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:18,422
- I want to know where you're going.
- No, please. Don't be angry.

1013
01:26:18,549 --> 01:26:21,425
It has nothing to do with you
or with any of all of this. It's just...

1014
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:23,928
- Where are you going?
- Please...

1015
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:28,641
Trust me this much.

1016
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:40,778
I'll be back.

1017
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,827
And there is...

1018
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,206
There is something
that I should tell you about.

1019
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:56,586
The fishing club
that old lady mentioned...

1020
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:01,173
- The pieces of the flag... Yes.
- The Albacore Club.

1021
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,926
- It has to do with my father.
- I know.

1022
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:06,596
He owns it... You know?

1023
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:08,931
I saw him.

1024
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:13,978
You saw

1025
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,272
my father?

1026
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:22,612
- What... When?
- This morning.

1027
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,450
You didn't tell me.

1028
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:30,328
Well, there hasn't been much time.

1029
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:31,996
What...

1030
01:27:32,706 --> 01:27:41,505
What did he say?

1031
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,966
That you were jealous.

1032
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,553
And that he was afraid
what you might do.

1033
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,847
Do? To whom?

1034
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:53,392
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.

1035
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:58,189
He wanted to know where she was.

1036
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,361
I want you to listen to me.

1037
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:08,032
Now, my father is
a very dangerous man.

1038
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:11,827
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

1039
01:28:12,996 --> 01:28:16,374
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be behind all this?

1040
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,042
It's possible.

1041
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:27,093
Even the death of your husband?

1042
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,719
It's possible.

1043
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:31,180
Now, please,
don't ask me any more questions now,

1044
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:33,432
just wait. Wait for me here.

1045
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,227
I need you here.

1046
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:46,792
No, no. Here.

1047
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:17,948
Give me the keys.

1048
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,243
You...

1049
01:32:21,328 --> 01:32:24,788
It's either that
or you drive yourself to the police.

1050
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:26,290
The police?

1051
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,292
Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.

1052
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:32,004
You've got your husband's girlfriend
tied up in there.

1053
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,423
- She's not tied up.
- You know what I mean.

1054
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:37,801
- You're holding her against her will.
- I am not!

1055
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:41,597
- Okay. Then let's go talk to her.
- No!

1056
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:44,600
She's...

1057
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:46,477
She's too upset.

1058
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:49,688
What about?

1059
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,857
Hollis's death.

1060
01:32:52,943 --> 01:32:54,151
I tried to keep it from her.

1061
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:58,781
I didn't want her to know until
I could make plans for us to leave.

1062
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:01,617
You mean she just found out about it?

1063
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,664
That's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.

1064
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,041
What does it look like?

1065
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:12,378
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

1066
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,506
You're insane.

1067
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:18,133
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police.

1068
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:21,887
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

1069
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,352
You won't go to the police if I tell you?

1070
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:30,312
I will if you don't.

1071
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:49,039
She...

1072
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,001
She's my sister.

1073
01:33:58,383 --> 01:33:59,883
Take it easy.

1074
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:03,512
If she's your sister, she's your sister.

1075
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:05,931
Why all the secrecy?

1076
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:09,351
I can't.

1077
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:14,064
Is it because of Hollis? Because she
was seeing your husband? Is that it?

1078
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,612
I would never have harmed Hollis.

1079
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:25,409
He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.

1080
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:31,582
And he put up with more from me
than you'll ever know.

1081
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:37,629
I wanted him to be happy.

1082
01:34:56,566 --> 01:35:00,778
I borrowed your husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

1083
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:03,614
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?

1084
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:06,658
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anybody about this.

1085
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:10,621
That's not what I meant.

1086
01:35:13,958 --> 01:35:15,125
Yeah.

1087
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:19,755
Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.

1088
01:35:20,924 --> 01:35:22,341
Good night.

1089
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:28,991
Gittes?

1090
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,869
- Gittes?
- Yeah?

1091
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,746
Ida Sessions wants to see you.

1092
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:38,542
- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.

1093
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:42,337
- Yeah, I do?
- Sure, you do.

1094
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:47,718
I tell you what, pal.

1095
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:53,223
If Ida wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.

1096
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:24,671
848-1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.

1097
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:27,883
She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.

1098
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,906
Find anything interesting, Gittes?

1099
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,204
What are you doing around here?

1100
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:46,123
Didn't you call me?

1101
01:40:47,917 --> 01:40:50,293
How come you happen to know her?

1102
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,003
I don't.

1103
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:57,634
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1104
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:09,813
- Isn't that your phone number?
- Is it?

1105
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:12,149
I forget. I don't call myself that often.

1106
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:15,277
Well, just to make sure,
we had Loach here give you a call.

1107
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:17,028
What happened to your nose, Gittes?

1108
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:19,322
Somebody slam
a bedroom window on it?

1109
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:25,620
Nope. Your wife got excited.
She crossed her legs a little too quick.

1110
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:27,622
You understand what I mean, pal?

1111
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:29,666
Loach.

1112
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:51,855
They look familiar?

1113
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:56,359
- Yeah. I took them. So what?
- How did she happen to have them?

1114
01:41:56,486 --> 01:42:00,071
Either you tell me or I guess.
I don't know the answer.

1115
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,699
You must really think I'm stupid,
don't you, Gittes?

1116
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:04,242
I don't think about it that much,

1117
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:07,370
but give me a day or two
and I'll get back to you.

1118
01:42:07,497 --> 01:42:10,999
- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.

1119
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:12,667
What pictures?

1120
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:16,838
This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.

1121
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:18,381
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1122
01:42:19,509 --> 01:42:21,176
Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down,

1123
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:22,844
she hired you.

1124
01:42:22,929 --> 01:42:25,430
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

1125
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:28,558
- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.

1126
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:32,020
Who the hell do you think you're
dealing with, a bunch of assholes?

1127
01:42:32,104 --> 01:42:34,439
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

1128
01:42:36,526 --> 01:42:39,444
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.

1129
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,571
You even took pictures of it.

1130
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:42,823
It was Evelyn Mulwray,

1131
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:46,159
and she's been paying you off
like a slot machine ever since.

1132
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:49,037
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.

1133
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,831
I don't think I need a day or two.

1134
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:53,083
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

1135
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:56,211
Not only that, but I wouldn't extort
a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.

1136
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:57,921
That's where I draw the line.

1137
01:42:58,047 --> 01:43:00,173
I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.

1138
01:43:00,258 --> 01:43:02,008
We're talking about accessory
after the fact,

1139
01:43:02,093 --> 01:43:03,802
conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.

1140
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:06,346
What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean,

1141
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,764
then dragged him up to a reservoir

1142
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:10,725
because she thought
it would look more like an accident?

1143
01:43:12,103 --> 01:43:13,436
Mulwray was murdered and moved

1144
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:17,274
because somebody didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

1145
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,400
Why is that?

1146
01:43:18,484 --> 01:43:20,443
He found out
they were dumping water there.

1147
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:23,488
That's what they were trying to cover up.

1148
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:28,410
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.

1149
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:32,831
Come on, Lou. You're in charge.
Make a decision.

1150
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,684
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?

1151
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:55,353
They only dump the water at night.

1152
01:43:57,106 --> 01:44:00,066
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

1153
01:44:00,151 --> 01:44:02,903
- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...

1154
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:05,363
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.

1155
01:44:06,866 --> 01:44:07,949
Go on!

1156
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:09,910
Yelburton says there's irrigation
in the Valley,

1157
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:12,203
and there's always a little run-off
after they do that.

1158
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,830
And he says Gittes knows this,

1159
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:18,418
and he's been going around making
irresponsible accusations all last week.

1160
01:44:18,502 --> 01:44:20,211
Lou, let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.

1161
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:22,130
What the hell are we waiting for?

1162
01:44:22,214 --> 01:44:26,843
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

1163
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,099
Have your client in my office
in two hours.

1164
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:35,727
And remember,
I don't have to let you go.

1165
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,897
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

1166
01:44:40,066 --> 01:44:41,358
Loach?

1167
01:45:26,946 --> 01:45:28,863
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

1168
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,200
These her bags?

1169
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:36,788
Is she going on a trip?

1170
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:40,458
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

1171
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:43,962
- Is she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.

1172
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:48,425
"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?

1173
01:45:55,599 --> 01:45:57,517
Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.

1174
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:59,936
Oh, yes. Bad for glass.

1175
01:46:00,438 --> 01:46:02,772
Salt water very bad for grass.

1176
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:19,956
Salt water?

1177
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:23,418
Very, very bad. See?

1178
01:46:32,303 --> 01:46:33,762
What's that?

1179
01:46:35,473 --> 01:46:36,973
Right there.

1180
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:41,978
There.

1181
01:47:39,745 --> 01:47:41,663
- You wait.
- You wait.

1182
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:49,462
How are you? I've been calling you.

1183
01:47:49,547 --> 01:47:51,005
- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.

1184
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:53,258
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

1185
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:56,761
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

1186
01:47:56,887 --> 01:48:00,056
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

1187
01:48:00,182 --> 01:48:01,891
I want to see her.

1188
01:48:02,268 --> 01:48:06,229
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?

1189
01:48:06,355 --> 01:48:08,022
Going someplace?

1190
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:11,734
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.

1191
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:16,739
Jake?

1192
01:48:26,292 --> 01:48:28,918
J.J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.

1193
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:32,005
But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1194
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:36,259
- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.

1195
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:37,927
Lieutenant Escobar.

1196
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:39,137
- Lou?
- Yeah.

1197
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:41,973
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

1198
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,768
Yeah. Soon as you can.

1199
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:48,605
Why did you do that?

1200
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:51,900
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.

1201
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:56,571
Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.

1202
01:48:57,114 --> 01:49:00,074
They're expensive, but you can afford it.

1203
01:49:00,826 --> 01:49:04,078
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

1204
01:49:16,008 --> 01:49:19,010
I found these in your backyard
in the pond.

1205
01:49:20,137 --> 01:49:22,847
They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?

1206
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:24,474
Didn't they?

1207
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:28,603
- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.

1208
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:30,813
It's where he was drowned.

1209
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,023
What?

1210
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:34,734
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

1211
01:49:34,818 --> 01:49:36,319
The coroner's report proves

1212
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:38,780
that he had salt water in his lungs
when he was killed.

1213
01:49:38,864 --> 01:49:40,240
Just take my word for it, all right?

1214
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:42,408
Now, I want to know how it happened,
and I want to know why,

1215
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:44,535
and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,

1216
01:49:44,662 --> 01:49:46,579
because I don't want to lose my license.

1217
01:49:46,664 --> 01:49:50,750
I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...

1218
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:52,335
Stop it!

1219
01:49:52,461 --> 01:49:54,170
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

1220
01:49:54,296 --> 01:49:57,006
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.

1221
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:58,174
It was an accident!

1222
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,927
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

1223
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:02,178
You don't have the guts to harm her,

1224
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:04,138
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

1225
01:50:04,223 --> 01:50:05,848
- Yes or no?
- No!

1226
01:50:07,142 --> 01:50:09,519
Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,

1227
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:11,688
because you don't have a sister.

1228
01:50:11,814 --> 01:50:13,481
I'll tell you...

1229
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:15,900
I'll tell you the truth.

1230
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,696
Good. What's her name?

1231
01:50:21,532 --> 01:50:24,325
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

1232
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:28,538
She's my daughter.

1233
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:31,708
I said I want the truth!

1234
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:34,002
She's my sister.

1235
01:50:35,379 --> 01:50:37,088
She's my daughter.

1236
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:40,091
My sister, my daughter!

1237
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:42,719
I said I want the truth!

1238
01:50:42,845 --> 01:50:44,220
All of it!

1239
01:50:46,432 --> 01:50:49,225
She's my sister and my daughter!

1240
01:50:53,188 --> 01:50:55,064
Kahn, please, go back.

1241
01:50:55,607 --> 01:50:58,026
For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!

1242
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:07,410
My father and I...

1243
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:13,374
Understand?

1244
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:16,419
Or is it too tough for you?

1245
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,055
He raped you?

1246
01:51:43,781 --> 01:51:45,490
Then what happened?

1247
01:51:45,783 --> 01:51:47,200
I ran away.

1248
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:48,951
To Mexico.

1249
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:58,836
Hollis came and took care of me.

1250
01:52:01,924 --> 01:52:03,758
I couldn't see her.

1251
01:52:04,927 --> 01:52:06,344
I was 15.

1252
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:11,974
I wanted to, but I...

1253
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:14,644
I couldn't.

1254
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:18,481
Then...

1255
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:23,319
Now I want to be with her.

1256
01:52:24,113 --> 01:52:26,280
I want to take care of her.

1257
01:52:26,615 --> 01:52:28,825
Where are you going to take her now?

1258
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:30,493
Back to Mexico.

1259
01:52:31,829 --> 01:52:36,582
Well, you can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.

1260
01:52:38,961 --> 01:52:43,881
Well, how about a plane?

1261
01:52:43,966 --> 01:52:45,174
No, that's worse.

1262
01:52:45,259 --> 01:52:48,636
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.

1263
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:52,598
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

1264
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:54,809
All right.

1265
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:01,816
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

1266
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:03,901
How do you know?

1267
01:53:04,236 --> 01:53:06,279
He didn't wear bifocals.

1268
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:41,522
Katherine, say hello to Mr. Gittes.

1269
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:45,067
Hello.

1270
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:53,618
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

1271
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:57,830
Sure.

1272
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:20,686
J.J. Gittes and Associates.

1273
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:23,606
- Sophie, get me Walsh.
- Yes, Mr. Gittes.

1274
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:26,275
- Jake?
- Yeah.

1275
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:29,987
Listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
and book me in about five minutes.

1276
01:54:30,072 --> 01:54:31,614
What? What the hell's the matter?
What...

1277
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:33,699
Relax and I'll tell you.

1278
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:35,952
Wait in the office for me
about two hours.

1279
01:54:36,036 --> 01:54:40,623
If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy
meet me at 1712 Alameda.

1280
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:44,335
Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?

1281
01:54:44,461 --> 01:54:46,379
I know where it is. Just do it.

1282
01:54:46,463 --> 01:54:48,548
1712 Alameda...

1283
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:18,995
Come on in, Lou.

1284
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:24,125
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

1285
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:32,758
I don't suppose you have any idea
where she went.

1286
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:35,636
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?

1287
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:38,598
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.

1288
01:55:38,682 --> 01:55:40,850
What's the maid's address?

1289
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:43,227
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.

1290
01:55:43,312 --> 01:55:46,314
No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.

1291
01:55:47,065 --> 01:55:48,399
What for?

1292
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:51,319
Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,

1293
01:55:51,403 --> 01:55:54,614
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

1294
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,867
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

1295
01:55:59,244 --> 01:56:02,163
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

1296
01:56:15,344 --> 01:56:19,096
- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?

1297
01:56:19,598 --> 01:56:22,350
I'd like to bring her out myself.

1298
01:56:22,434 --> 01:56:25,978
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

1299
01:56:26,063 --> 01:56:29,982
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.

1300
01:56:30,067 --> 01:56:31,442
And to me.

1301
01:56:36,073 --> 01:56:38,491
You never learn, do you, Jake?

1302
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,661
I guess not.

1303
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,165
Okay. But...

1304
01:56:48,085 --> 01:56:50,169
I'll give you three minutes.

1305
01:56:50,253 --> 01:56:51,754
Just three minutes.

1306
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:53,589
Gee, thanks, Lou.

1307
01:57:09,690 --> 01:57:10,898
Yes?

1308
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:13,234
Hello.

1309
01:57:14,194 --> 01:57:17,655
Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.

1310
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:19,615
Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?

1311
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:21,701
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

1312
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:22,993
No, thanks.

1313
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:24,870
How about a glass of wine?

1314
01:57:24,955 --> 01:57:27,623
- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.

1315
01:57:27,708 --> 01:57:31,043
No, thank you, Curly, very much,
but I would like a glass of water, though.

1316
01:57:31,128 --> 01:57:33,087
Come on out in the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?

1317
01:57:33,171 --> 01:57:34,547
Sure thing.

1318
01:57:38,593 --> 01:57:40,511
- Curly, where's your car?
- In the garage.

1319
01:57:40,595 --> 01:57:42,805
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.

1320
01:57:42,889 --> 01:57:45,516
- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.

1321
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,977
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

1322
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:51,313
- I'll tell my wife.
- Tell her later, Curl, huh?

1323
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:26,390
Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?

1324
01:58:26,516 --> 01:58:30,895
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

1325
01:58:32,189 --> 01:58:33,939
How much do you owe me?

1326
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:37,026
Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.

1327
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:40,863
I know you been real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.

1328
01:58:40,989 --> 01:58:42,823
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off

1329
01:58:42,908 --> 01:58:46,076
by taking a couple of passengers
to Ensenada?

1330
01:58:46,203 --> 01:58:49,663
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

1331
01:58:49,748 --> 01:58:54,084
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

1332
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:56,504
Maybe even 100.

1333
01:58:57,964 --> 01:59:00,883
- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.

1334
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:05,638
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.

1335
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:08,724
If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.

1336
01:59:21,822 --> 01:59:23,739
You sure this is okay?

1337
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:28,035
Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?

1338
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:59,483
Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

1339
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:02,778
You've got her? Where?

1340
02:00:02,863 --> 02:00:04,989
Do you remember
the figures we discussed?

1341
02:00:05,073 --> 02:00:07,241
Of course I do. Where are you?

1342
02:00:07,325 --> 02:00:10,703
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

1343
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:12,079
An hour.

1344
02:00:35,979 --> 02:00:37,855
Oh, there you are.

1345
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:42,359
Well, you don't look too much the worse
for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.

1346
02:00:43,153 --> 02:00:45,195
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.

1347
02:00:45,322 --> 02:00:47,573
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

1348
02:00:48,199 --> 02:00:49,992
Well, where is she?

1349
02:00:50,535 --> 02:00:52,286
With her mother.

1350
02:00:53,997 --> 02:00:57,166
I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.

1351
02:00:57,292 --> 02:00:58,417
What is it?

1352
02:00:58,501 --> 02:01:02,171
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

1353
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,006
I guess I can manage.

1354
02:01:13,808 --> 02:01:15,392
What does it mean?

1355
02:01:15,518 --> 02:01:17,853
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

1356
02:01:18,855 --> 02:01:20,272
Right here,

1357
02:01:20,523 --> 02:01:22,107
in that pond.

1358
02:01:22,776 --> 02:01:24,443
You drowned him.

1359
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:27,488
And you left these.

1360
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:33,827
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

1361
02:01:37,374 --> 02:01:41,543
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

1362
02:01:42,545 --> 02:01:44,630
You know what he used to say?

1363
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:46,298
I haven't the faintest idea.

1364
02:01:46,383 --> 02:01:48,467
"That's where life begins."

1365
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,427
Sloughs, tide pools.

1366
02:01:52,055 --> 02:01:53,138
When we first come out here,

1367
02:01:53,223 --> 02:01:55,975
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand

1368
02:01:56,059 --> 02:02:00,062
and let it percolate down to the bedrock,
it would stay there

1369
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:03,232
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs.

1370
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:06,986
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

1371
02:02:07,070 --> 02:02:08,904
And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley.

1372
02:02:08,989 --> 02:02:10,364
It's what I am doing.

1373
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:12,366
When the bond issue passes Tuesday,

1374
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:14,743
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.

1375
02:02:14,828 --> 02:02:16,286
I'm doing it.

1376
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:17,955
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

1377
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:21,333
when they find out that they're paying
for water that they're not gonna get.

1378
02:02:21,418 --> 02:02:23,419
Oh, that's all taken care of.

1379
02:02:23,503 --> 02:02:27,589
See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring the water to L.A.,

1380
02:02:27,674 --> 02:02:30,009
or you bring L.A. To the water.

1381
02:02:30,635 --> 02:02:31,760
How are you gonna do that?

1382
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:35,681
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.

1383
02:02:37,392 --> 02:02:39,601
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.

1384
02:02:39,686 --> 02:02:40,811
How much do you want?

1385
02:02:40,895 --> 02:02:43,397
No, I just want to know
what you're worth. Over $10 million?

1386
02:02:43,481 --> 02:02:46,525
- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?

1387
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:47,735
How much better can you eat?

1388
02:02:47,819 --> 02:02:50,070
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

1389
02:02:50,155 --> 02:02:52,031
The future, Mr. Gitts!

1390
02:02:52,490 --> 02:02:53,907
The future!

1391
02:02:54,701 --> 02:02:56,577
Now, where's the girl?

1392
02:02:56,661 --> 02:02:58,996
I want the only daughter I've got left.

1393
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:02,291
As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

1394
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,752
Who do you blame for that? Her?

1395
02:03:05,295 --> 02:03:07,129
I don't blame myself.

1396
02:03:08,423 --> 02:03:11,717
See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact

1397
02:03:11,801 --> 02:03:14,386
that at the right time and the right place,

1398
02:03:14,471 --> 02:03:16,680
they're capable of anything.

1399
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:22,144
Claude, take those glasses from him,
will you?

1400
02:03:29,319 --> 02:03:31,612
It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.

1401
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:35,657
It's really not worth it.

1402
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:43,290
Where's the girl?

1403
02:04:38,388 --> 02:04:41,557
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?

1404
02:04:41,641 --> 02:04:45,185
Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...

1405
02:04:46,396 --> 02:04:48,564
You're under arrest, Jake.

1406
02:04:50,692 --> 02:04:51,817
Good news.

1407
02:04:51,901 --> 02:04:55,571
Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.

1408
02:04:55,655 --> 02:04:57,990
I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.

1409
02:04:58,074 --> 02:05:01,410
This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.

1410
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:03,662
He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.

1411
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:04,830
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.

1412
02:05:04,914 --> 02:05:05,998
That's all I need.

1413
02:05:06,082 --> 02:05:08,250
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!

1414
02:05:08,376 --> 02:05:10,502
He thinks he can get away
with anything!

1415
02:05:10,587 --> 02:05:12,838
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

1416
02:05:12,922 --> 02:05:16,717
Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.

1417
02:05:17,385 --> 02:05:19,845
- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!

1418
02:05:19,929 --> 02:05:21,597
He killed Mulwray because
of the water thing!

1419
02:05:21,723 --> 02:05:22,764
- I'm telling...
- Water?

1420
02:05:22,849 --> 02:05:23,932
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

1421
02:05:24,058 --> 02:05:26,852
Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.

1422
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:30,689
Lou, you don't know
what's going on here. I'm telling you.

1423
02:05:30,773 --> 02:05:32,191
Katherine!

1424
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:33,525
Katherine.

1425
02:05:33,610 --> 02:05:38,530
- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.

1426
02:05:38,615 --> 02:05:40,282
- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.

1427
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:42,034
Katherine, get in the car.

1428
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:43,535
- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...

1429
02:05:43,620 --> 02:05:46,788
No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.

1430
02:05:47,624 --> 02:05:49,625
Get away from her. Get away!

1431
02:05:49,751 --> 02:05:54,546
Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.

1432
02:05:54,631 --> 02:05:57,049
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

1433
02:05:57,133 --> 02:05:58,467
Evelyn!

1434
02:05:59,636 --> 02:06:02,554
How many years have I got?

1435
02:06:03,139 --> 02:06:04,723
She's mine, too.

1436
02:06:04,807 --> 02:06:07,226
She's never going to know that!

1437
02:06:09,395 --> 02:06:13,649
Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
You cannot hope to provide.

1438
02:06:13,733 --> 02:06:16,485
Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!

1439
02:06:16,611 --> 02:06:18,445
He owns the police!

1440
02:06:19,239 --> 02:06:20,822
Get away from her.

1441
02:06:20,907 --> 02:06:24,117
- You'll have to kill me first.
- Get away! Get...

1442
02:06:25,286 --> 02:06:27,412
Katherine, close the door.

1443
02:06:28,248 --> 02:06:29,414
Halt!

1444
02:07:09,872 --> 02:07:11,331
Oh, no!

1445
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:14,126
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

1446
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:16,211
- No!
- Turn him loose. Turn them all loose.

1447
02:07:16,337 --> 02:07:17,879
- Lord.
- No!

1448
02:07:21,509 --> 02:07:24,553
Lord.

1449
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,681
No! No!

1450
02:07:29,434 --> 02:07:33,228
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

1451
02:07:45,783 --> 02:07:48,452
- As little as possible.
- What's that?

1452
02:07:51,748 --> 02:07:53,248
What's that?

1453
02:07:57,754 --> 02:08:00,630
You want to do your partner
a big favor?

1454
02:08:02,258 --> 02:08:03,800
Take him home.

1455
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:08,972
Take him home!

1456
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:11,767
Just get him the hell out of here!

1457
02:08:11,893 --> 02:08:13,435
Come on, Jake.

1458
02:08:14,437 --> 02:08:15,979
Go home, Jake.

1459
02:08:16,981 --> 02:08:19,066
I'm doing you a favor.

1460
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:22,152
Come on, Jake.

1461
02:08:25,281 --> 02:08:27,657
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.

1462
02:08:42,507 --> 02:08:46,385
All right, come on. Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!

1463
02:08:48,388 --> 02:08:50,138
On the sidewalk!

1464
02:08:52,225 --> 02:08:58,146
Get off the street!
