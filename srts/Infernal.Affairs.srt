00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:35,787
BOSTON
A few years ago

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,060
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

4
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,874
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

5
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,343
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

6
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:59,144
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

7
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:03,684
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

8
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:06,053
It put hate in your heart.

9
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:09,626
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

10
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:11,026
<i>True guineas.</i>

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,725
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

12
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:20,301
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

13
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:24,605
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

14
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,081
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

15
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:32,517
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

16
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,816
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

17
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:36,891
<i>You have to take it.</i>

18
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,116
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

19
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,778
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

20
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:11,224
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

21
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,489
You should be proud.

22
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:28,870
You get your period yet, Carmen?

23
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,999
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

24
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,167
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,705
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

26
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,438
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

27
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:04,176
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

28
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,045
You do good in school?

29
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:13,193
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

30
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,956
They call that a paradox.

31
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,065
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

32
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:30,837
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

33
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:33,710
You know where I am on L Street?

34
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:35,510
Good.

35
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:38,210
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

36
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:44,154
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

37
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:46,318
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

38
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:49,624
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,098
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

40
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,829
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

41
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:58,498
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

42
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:00,837
A man makes his own way.

43
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:02,604
No one gives it to you.

44
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,645
You have to take it.

45
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,085
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

46
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:11,719
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

47
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,586
...tried to tell me what to do.

48
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,526
And something maybe happened to them.

49
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,698
Maybe like that:

50
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:33,203
Jeez. She fell funny.

51
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,615
Francis, you really should see somebody.

52
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:42,084
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

53
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:45,521
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

54
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:50,220
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

55
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:53,161
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

56
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,894
When you're facing a loaded gun...

57
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,036
...what's the difference?

58
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,010
<i>That's my boy.</i>

59
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:09,312
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

60
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:12,180
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

61
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,447
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9 mm hollow-point.

62
00:05:15,623 --> 00:05:19,252
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

63
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:22,295
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

64
00:05:22,465 --> 00:05:25,628
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

65
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:26,927
Sir, yes, sir!

66
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:30,539
<i>- tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

67
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,267
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

68
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:44,343
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

69
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:48,321
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

70
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:52,189
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

71
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,153
Pencils.

72
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:02,200
Begin.

73
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:11,938
What are you looking at?

74
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,153
Forget it.

75
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:19,950
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

76
00:06:22,828 --> 00:06:26,229
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

77
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,193
They are.

78
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:31,928
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

79
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:37,543
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

80
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,543
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

81
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:41,737
Fuck yourself.

82
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,281
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

83
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,010
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

84
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:50,453
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

85
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:54,124
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

86
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:57,389
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

87
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:01,331
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

88
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:06,872
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

89
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,976
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

90
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:12,238
Thank you. You are dismissed.

91
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:26,453
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

92
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,395
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

93
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:41,334
School's out.

94
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,048
Thank you, Frank.

95
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:46,839
You earned it.

96
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,077
No more pencils, no more books.

97
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:53,778
All right.

98
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,481
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

99
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,559
<i>...this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

100
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,854
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

101
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,727
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

102
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,265
<i>What's the difference?</i>

103
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,835
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

104
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:10,065
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

105
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,404
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

106
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:27,324
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

107
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:30,985
...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

108
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,030
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

109
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:38,033
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

110
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:42,703
You're a worker. You rise fast.

111
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:44,867
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

112
00:08:46,446 --> 00:08:49,074
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

113
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:51,615
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

114
00:08:57,925 --> 00:09:01,019
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

115
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:05,822
You can go in there now.

116
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,733
You can sit.

117
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:20,413
So...

118
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,350
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

119
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:29,317
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

120
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:31,185
...and leave it at that, okay?

121
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,852
No idea. Zip. None.

122
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:37,956
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

123
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,658
We would be cunts.

124
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,861
Are you calling us cunts?

125
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:44,438
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

126
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:47,542
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

127
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:52,172
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

128
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:54,874
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

129
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:01,691
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

130
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:06,158
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

131
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,062
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

132
00:10:12,337 --> 00:10:14,168
That's right.

133
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:16,731
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

134
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,137
Closed casket?

135
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,575
That's right.

136
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,116
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

137
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:28,412
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

138
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,987
- you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

139
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,928
I got a question.

140
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,155
How fucked up are you?

141
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:52,570
Hi, Darlene.

142
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:58,979
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

143
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:03,957
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

144
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:08,088
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

145
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:11,390
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

146
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:14,228
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

147
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:19,138
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

148
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,403
You got any suits,
or do you like...

149
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:24,410
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

150
00:11:26,648 --> 00:11:29,412
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

151
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:32,952
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

152
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:36,147
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

153
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:39,659
...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

154
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,592
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

155
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:48,935
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

156
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:52,666
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

157
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:55,936
This is an elite unit.

158
00:11:56,112 --> 00:12:00,379
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

159
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,610
...organized crime in this city...

160
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:05,516
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

161
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:08,453
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

162
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:10,787
And we will do it.

163
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:14,419
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

164
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,894
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

165
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,127
Jackie met his demise.

166
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,234
Last known photograph.

167
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,866
Costello uses three key guys.

168
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:28,570
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

169
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,443
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

170
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:33,709
Delahunt, muscle.

171
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,845
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

172
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,754
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

173
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,088
...so I can pass them off as my own.

174
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,390
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

175
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,329
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

176
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,798
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

177
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,940
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

178
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,575
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

179
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,211
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

180
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,247
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

181
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,318
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

182
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,784
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

183
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,825
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

184
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,224
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

185
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,330
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

186
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,764
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

187
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:24,905
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

188
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:27,564
...on the weekends. I got that right?

189
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:31,507
Yup.
You have different accents?

190
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,572
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

191
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,981
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

192
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:41,122
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

193
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,782
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

194
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,024
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

195
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:54,526
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

196
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:57,332
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

197
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:01,799
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

198
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:07,145
We have a question.

199
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,983
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

200
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:14,454
It's an honest question.

201
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:18,288
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

202
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:21,090
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

203
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:24,064
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

204
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:26,500
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

205
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:27,763
Hey, he can't help you.

206
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:29,907
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

207
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:31,440
...and I know what you're not.

208
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,046
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

209
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:37,181
You're no fucking cop.

210
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,879
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

211
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,888
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

212
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,891
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

213
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:51,656
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

214
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:54,492
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

215
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,759
Guaran-fucking-teed.

216
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:02,668
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

217
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,773
You don't have much family.

218
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:09,442
I don't have any family.

219
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:18,458
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

220
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,561
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

221
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,131
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

222
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,134
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

223
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:34,298
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

224
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,711
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

225
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,907
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

226
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:44,780
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

227
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:49,653
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

228
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:54,593
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

229
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:01,737
Do you need some money for the funeral?

230
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:07,769
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

231
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:13,375
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

232
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:16,179
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

233
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:19,585
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

234
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:23,716
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

235
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:27,297
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

236
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:32,031
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

237
00:16:32,204 --> 00:16:34,035
A state-police detective.

238
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,541
And are you a married
state-police detective?

239
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:39,209
No.

240
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:42,807
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

241
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:45,006
I have a co-signer.

242
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:49,879
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

243
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:52,354
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

244
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:54,988
Sure.

245
00:16:55,461 --> 00:17:00,296
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

246
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:02,991
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

247
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,367
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

248
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,737
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

249
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:12,708
Amen.

250
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:36,135
So what do I do?

251
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:40,271
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

252
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,536
...but there's a bonus involved.

253
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,045
Tax-free.

254
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:50,951
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

255
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,851
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

256
00:17:55,024 --> 00:17:56,082
Given your nature.

257
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,262
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

258
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:01,954
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

259
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,827
...the whole nine yards.

260
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:08,328
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

261
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,863
We need you, pal.

262
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,908
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

263
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:18,037
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

264
00:18:19,751 --> 00:18:21,548
Do it again.

265
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,381
For me.

266
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:01,627
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

267
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:04,696
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

268
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:08,197
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

269
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,030
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

270
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,887
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

271
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:32,993
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

272
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:36,153
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

273
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:40,498
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

274
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:42,933
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

275
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:45,335
Yeah, it was in the papers.

276
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,871
So you know.

277
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:51,878
And why are we graced
with your presence?

278
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:54,850
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

279
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:58,146
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

280
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:00,950
My mother's dead.

281
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,519
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

282
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:08,256
I was at a funeral myself, man.

283
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,433
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

284
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,864
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

285
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,201
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

286
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,700
I got, like...

287
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:25,338
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

288
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:28,281
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

289
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:31,115
In your line of work, if I gave you...

290
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,986
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

291
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,525
You know what you...

292
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,028
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

293
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,296
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

294
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:49,373
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

295
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,169
What, you want me to say it?

296
00:20:54,947 --> 00:20:57,882
I'm not a cop, all right?

297
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:02,218
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

298
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:06,183
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

299
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:10,921
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

300
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:14,625
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

301
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:18,272
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

302
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:21,533
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

303
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:24,678
That's right. You used to be a cop.

304
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:28,280
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

305
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:31,907
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

306
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:33,519
This side of Worcester.

307
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:37,419
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

308
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:39,584
God says, as far as you're...

309
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:41,593
...concerned.

310
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,635
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

311
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:50,169
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

312
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:53,103
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

313
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:55,744
Well, I knew his father.

314
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:58,639
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

315
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:01,306
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

316
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:03,452
Fucking guineas.

317
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,120
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

318
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,381
Cranberry juice.

319
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:12,722
It's a natural diuretic.

320
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:16,094
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

321
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,199
What, do you got your period?

322
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:25,841
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

323
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:32,645
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

324
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,711
Do you know me?

325
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,750
No. No.

326
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:42,124
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

327
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,285
...and there's guys you can't.

328
00:22:44,462 --> 00:22:46,453
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

329
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,896
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

330
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,730
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

331
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,930
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

332
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,303
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

333
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:05,409
I fucking know you. I know your family.

334
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,545
You make one more drug deal...

335
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:10,554
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

336
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:14,020
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

337
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:17,288
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

338
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:22,197
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

339
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,629
What are you drinking?

340
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,607
A cranberry juice.

341
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,077
What is it, your period?

342
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:44,354
Get him a cranberry juice.

343
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:52,924
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

344
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,766
What? "Oh," fucking what?

345
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:01,908
Get the fuck out of here.

346
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,746
Sorry I'm late.

347
00:24:03,913 --> 00:24:06,848
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

348
00:24:07,017 --> 00:24:08,609
His undercover work is extensive.

349
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:11,015
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

350
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:13,417
Okay, my people are out there.

351
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,150
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

352
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:18,761
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

353
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:21,762
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

354
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:24,867
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

355
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:27,300
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

356
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:29,735
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

357
00:24:30,274 --> 00:24:31,741
Good. Today, girls...

358
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:33,809
...what I have is microprocessors.

359
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:38,312
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

360
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:41,043
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

361
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:43,483
These are the kind
they put into computers...

362
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:46,488
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

363
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:48,489
...from a couple hundred miles away.

364
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,493
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

365
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:54,223
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

366
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,335
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

367
00:24:57,503 --> 00:24:59,562
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

368
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:02,105
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

369
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:04,436
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

370
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,168
Southie projects.

371
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:09,008
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

372
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:12,208
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

373
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,115
...which happens to...
- South Boston?

374
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:17,348
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

375
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:20,721
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

376
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,623
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

377
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,232
We're here to nail Costello.

378
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,868
All right, look. We got a guy...

379
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:31,562
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

380
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,208
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

381
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:36,776
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

382
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:40,381
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

383
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,279
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

384
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:47,051
Maybe. Maybe not.

385
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:48,918
Maybe fuck yourself.

386
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,423
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

387
00:25:51,594 --> 00:25:53,494
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

388
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:55,289
You girls have a good day.

389
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:59,761
Normally he's a very nice guy.

390
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,835
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

391
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:08,071
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

392
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:09,974
I knew Myles.

393
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:12,980
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

394
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,311
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

395
00:26:15,485 --> 00:26:18,477
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

396
00:26:18,655 --> 00:26:21,488
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

397
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,490
Allegedly.

398
00:26:24,428 --> 00:26:25,657
Allegedly.

399
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,298
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

400
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,434
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

401
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,660
He did something else wrong?

402
00:26:34,939 --> 00:26:37,965
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

403
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:42,006
I mean, fuck yourself.

404
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,117
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

405
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:49,721
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

406
00:26:51,223 --> 00:26:52,690
I need a cup of coffee.

407
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:08,703
You making a house call?

408
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:11,333
Have I seen you professionally?

409
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:15,003
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

410
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:18,844
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

411
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:22,614
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

412
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,624
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

413
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,455
I have an appointment on this floor.

414
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:32,087
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

415
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,359
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

416
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:36,628
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

417
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:39,933
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

418
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:41,405
Suffolk, nights?

419
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,443
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

420
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:48,105
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

421
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:51,047
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

422
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:53,881
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

423
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:56,854
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

424
00:27:57,026 --> 00:28:02,123
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

425
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:04,528
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

426
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,726
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

427
00:28:07,904 --> 00:28:09,394
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

428
00:28:19,316 --> 00:28:23,013
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

429
00:28:23,186 --> 00:28:26,019
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

430
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:29,317
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

431
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:32,622
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

432
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:34,094
All right, have a nice day.

433
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:37,095
Cut him here.

434
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:39,336
Bye-bye.

435
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:44,599
Jerk-ass!

436
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:47,438
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

437
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:51,140
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

438
00:28:51,317 --> 00:28:54,286
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

439
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:56,944
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

440
00:28:57,122 --> 00:29:00,148
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

441
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:01,554
I'm trying to help you.

442
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:05,163
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

443
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:08,790
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

444
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:12,427
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

445
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:15,439
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

446
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:18,043
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

447
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:21,078
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

448
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:23,477
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

449
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,881
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

450
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:29,147
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

451
00:29:29,323 --> 00:29:30,847
You fellas come from Providence?

452
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:33,084
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

453
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,785
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

454
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:48,804
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

455
00:29:49,544 --> 00:29:50,738
Fuck!

456
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:54,075
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

457
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:01,355
Get out of here. Get out of here!

458
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:11,694
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

459
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:15,929
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

460
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:24,580
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

461
00:30:24,748 --> 00:30:26,306
Was your meal okay?

462
00:30:26,483 --> 00:30:28,041
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

463
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:31,619
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

464
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:39,125
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

465
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:42,232
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

466
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,765
I don't even know what it is.

467
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,874
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

468
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:55,910
...in your office all day long?

469
00:30:56,082 --> 00:30:58,710
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

470
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:02,418
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

471
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:03,987
- No, no, no.
- No?

472
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:06,488
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

473
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,055
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

474
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:11,628
Yeah, I do.

475
00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:14,963
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

476
00:31:15,936 --> 00:31:18,769
Who says I wanna see you again?

477
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:24,405
Don't you?

478
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:28,046
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

479
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:29,648
Course I wanna see you again.

480
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,376
What Freud said about the Irish is...

481
00:31:32,553 --> 00:31:36,819
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

482
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:40,124
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

483
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:43,457
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

484
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:45,622
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

485
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,961
Why do you do it, then?

486
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,298
Some people do get better.

487
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:55,640
Fair enough.

488
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:59,508
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

489
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:01,710
Including the criminals?

490
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:04,148
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

491
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,048
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

492
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:12,053
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

493
00:32:12,228 --> 00:32:14,321
I'll arrest you right now.

494
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,432
<i>My word against yours.</i>

495
00:32:18,001 --> 00:32:21,528
- then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

496
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:24,739
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

497
00:32:24,908 --> 00:32:28,936
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

498
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:34,015
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

499
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,051
Schuyler.

500
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,034
Do you know who I am?

501
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,799
No.

502
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:07,149
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

503
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:19,821
His real name Mr. French?

504
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,397
No.

505
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,976
Come with me.

506
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:38,781
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

507
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:45,451
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

508
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:49,495
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

509
00:33:55,536 --> 00:33:58,404
Those guys you tuned up...

510
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:00,735
...they're connected down Providence.

511
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:03,643
What they're gonna do...

512
00:34:03,812 --> 00:34:07,407
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

513
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,609
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

514
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:13,186
Unless I stop them.

515
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:15,424
Do you want me to stop them?

516
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:20,791
Is this something I can't do personally?

517
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:26,465
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

518
00:34:26,636 --> 00:34:28,934
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

519
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:31,835
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

520
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,877
Shoes.

521
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,008
I knew your father.

522
00:34:44,155 --> 00:34:48,319
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

523
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:52,163
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

524
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:55,991
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

525
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,898
Yeah, that was his problem.

526
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,903
Who said he had a problem?

527
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,733
I just said he had a fucking problem.

528
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:09,378
There's a man could've been anything.

529
00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:11,949
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

530
00:35:12,118 --> 00:35:15,554
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

531
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:17,587
- He's clean.
- Arm.

532
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:19,019
Yeah, come on.

533
00:35:19,192 --> 00:35:20,716
What arm? What fucking arm?

534
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:24,226
Show me your arm. Flip it.

535
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:34,565
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

536
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,641
He's clean.

537
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:41,076
And if I can slander my own
environment...

538
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:45,048
...it makes me sad, this regression.

539
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,180
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

540
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:54,658
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

541
00:35:55,397 --> 00:35:57,763
I just can't know.

542
00:35:58,233 --> 00:36:02,431
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

543
00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:06,833
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

544
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:10,345
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

545
00:36:10,513 --> 00:36:13,346
I am not a fucking cop!

546
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:19,186
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

547
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:22,484
Yes. Yes, yes.

548
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,687
All right, all right, all right.

549
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:28,660
You're okay. You'll be all right.

550
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,066
Get your hand taken care of.

551
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:37,698
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

552
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:42,605
As for our problem with Providence...

553
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:46,246
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

554
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:51,755
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

555
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,360
Just kidding. How's your mother?

556
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:01,766
She's on her way out.

557
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:04,994
We all are. Act accordingly.

558
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:07,534
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

559
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,867
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

560
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:13,136
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

561
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:16,641
Do you trust him?

562
00:37:17,283 --> 00:37:18,511
Well, these days...

563
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:20,810
...who's reliable?

564
00:37:21,354 --> 00:37:23,322
His Uncle Jackie was.

565
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:28,483
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

566
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,131
I'm reliable.

567
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:39,372
Arnold, you're one in a million.

568
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,202
Ten. Ten million.

569
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:46,841
What about your wife, Arnold?

570
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,908
Well, I thought she was.

571
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,184
She wasn't.

572
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,356
Well, she got reliable.

573
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:03,488
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

574
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,691
Another county heard from.

575
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,597
One too many. She got a big mouth.

576
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,864
Answer this for me, will you?

577
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:35,256
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

578
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:39,129
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

579
00:38:39,303 --> 00:38:42,067
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

580
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,706
Thanks.

581
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:50,205
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

582
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,178
Can I meet you for lunch?

583
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,612
All right, see you then.

584
00:38:58,056 --> 00:38:59,819
Who's the lead detective?

585
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:02,824
Good. He's a lox.

586
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:15,066
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

587
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:16,970
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

588
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:21,442
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

589
00:39:21,614 --> 00:39:23,810
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

590
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:27,143
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

591
00:39:32,459 --> 00:39:35,087
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

592
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:36,559
No wonder you get ahead.

593
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,795
Have a seat, Bill.

594
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:54,947
Do you know John Lennon?

595
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,111
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

596
00:40:01,657 --> 00:40:03,784
Lennon said:

597
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:06,221
"I'm an artist.

598
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:10,798
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

599
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,402
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

600
00:40:16,572 --> 00:40:19,837
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

601
00:40:27,317 --> 00:40:29,615
Smart-mouth.

602
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,453
Too bad.

603
00:40:33,656 --> 00:40:35,955
If you'll indulge me...

604
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:38,850
Now what?

605
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,331
Choir practice.

606
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,698
Choir practice...

607
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,974
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

608
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:56,877
...a man could look at anything...

609
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,709
...and make something out of it.

610
00:40:58,883 --> 00:41:00,350
For instance...

611
00:41:00,518 --> 00:41:02,918
...I look at you and I think:

612
00:41:03,855 --> 00:41:06,255
What could I use you for?

613
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:10,254
Get rid of this.

614
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,919
French.

615
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:14,566
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

616
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,429
Maybe we could work something out.

617
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:20,568
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

618
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,708
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

619
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,105
...which hand he jerked off with.

620
00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:27,212
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

621
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:31,049
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

622
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,923
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

623
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:44,788
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

624
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:47,230
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

625
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:49,802
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

626
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:52,269
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

627
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,307
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

628
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:58,411
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

629
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:00,979
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

630
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:03,413
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

631
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:04,573
...you let us know.

632
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:10,752
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

633
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,423
Jimmy Pappas.

634
00:42:13,595 --> 00:42:15,586
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

635
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:19,060
Jimmy had a rough month.

636
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:21,565
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

637
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:24,935
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

638
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:26,939
I believe it's been in the papers.

639
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,145
You seem quite happy with that result.

640
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:33,308
It's a fucking result.

641
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:36,748
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

642
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,946
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

643
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,192
I think you are a cop, my son.

644
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,524
- Where's your license?
- What license?

645
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,634
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

646
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:54,930
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

647
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,506
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

648
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,202
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

649
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:03,313
...into Mr. Costello's area.

650
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,247
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

651
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:12,447
Hey.

652
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:15,723
That's Jimmy Bags.

653
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:22,629
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

654
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,430
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

655
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:27,402
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

656
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:29,473
Then make more money.
This is America.

657
00:43:29,642 --> 00:43:32,941
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

658
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,741
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

659
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:38,009
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

660
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,710
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

661
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:44,015
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

662
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:47,058
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

663
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:51,459
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

664
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:53,359
Hi, Captain.

665
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:54,729
This crazy fuck...

666
00:43:54,903 --> 00:43:57,030
...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

667
00:43:57,205 --> 00:43:59,298
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

668
00:43:59,474 --> 00:44:02,307
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

669
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:03,739
He reached into his coat.

670
00:44:03,912 --> 00:44:06,142
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

671
00:44:06,314 --> 00:44:08,748
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

672
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:10,976
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

673
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:13,417
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

674
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:14,920
...which is the right thing.

675
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,718
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

676
00:44:18,227 --> 00:44:20,127
Bottom line...

677
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:22,389
...we think we might have a problem.

678
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:25,432
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

679
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:29,503
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

680
00:44:29,673 --> 00:44:31,971
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

681
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:34,736
No, no, not presently.

682
00:44:34,911 --> 00:44:36,344
But I'm working on that.

683
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:38,640
Here, Bill, this is for you.

684
00:44:39,316 --> 00:44:42,945
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

685
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,611
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

686
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,689
You wait. We'll call you.

687
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,521
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

688
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:54,631
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

689
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:56,426
Good.

690
00:44:57,935 --> 00:44:59,800
Hi, Dad.

691
00:45:00,504 --> 00:45:02,768
I got promoted. All right.

692
00:45:20,325 --> 00:45:22,293
Excuse me for one second.

693
00:45:23,396 --> 00:45:25,193
You know...

694
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:28,832
...if your father were alive...

695
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:31,061
...and saw you here sitting with me...

696
00:45:31,237 --> 00:45:33,501
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

697
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:36,471
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

698
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:38,873
And he could do it...

699
00:45:39,479 --> 00:45:43,348
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

700
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:52,718
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

701
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:56,385
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

702
00:45:56,563 --> 00:45:58,861
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

703
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:01,561
Your Uncle Jackie...

704
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:06,503
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

705
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,104
And I think about this.

706
00:46:17,018 --> 00:46:19,715
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

707
00:46:20,523 --> 00:46:23,424
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

708
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:25,617
School?

709
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,360
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

710
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:32,626
...school is out.

711
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:36,134
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

712
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:39,203
Good day, Fathers.

713
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,379
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

714
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:46,209
You recall our chat?

715
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:48,609
Little boys...

716
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:53,216
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

717
00:46:53,825 --> 00:46:56,225
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

718
00:46:58,296 --> 00:47:03,632
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

719
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:07,828
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

720
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:13,311
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

721
00:47:13,479 --> 00:47:16,880
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

722
00:47:17,683 --> 00:47:19,844
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

723
00:47:20,018 --> 00:47:21,713
Pay them.

724
00:47:22,988 --> 00:47:26,082
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

725
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:36,027
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

726
00:47:36,202 --> 00:47:38,568
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

727
00:47:38,738 --> 00:47:40,672
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

728
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,400
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

729
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:46,238
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

730
00:47:46,412 --> 00:47:49,041
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

731
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,183
Beeper number.

732
00:47:51,886 --> 00:47:54,184
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

733
00:47:55,256 --> 00:47:57,554
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

734
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:04,264
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

735
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:06,559
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

736
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:10,162
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

737
00:48:10,338 --> 00:48:12,397
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

738
00:48:12,574 --> 00:48:13,836
- It's off?
- You're good.

739
00:48:14,009 --> 00:48:16,671
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

740
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,173
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

741
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:22,805
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

742
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,977
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

743
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:27,816
...I need to be made aware of?

744
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:32,520
I beeped you.

745
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:35,822
The card they gave me. That's it.

746
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:39,399
- That's it?
- That's it.

747
00:48:42,606 --> 00:48:44,039
You need to call your mother...

748
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,506
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

749
00:48:51,215 --> 00:48:54,742
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

750
00:48:58,021 --> 00:49:01,355
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

751
00:49:01,593 --> 00:49:05,120
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

752
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:08,655
So make the call.

753
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:16,762
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

754
00:49:18,176 --> 00:49:20,839
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

755
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:42,125
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

756
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:44,236
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

757
00:49:45,772 --> 00:49:48,707
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

758
00:49:49,743 --> 00:49:52,974
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

759
00:49:53,146 --> 00:49:54,910
Bye.

760
00:49:55,116 --> 00:49:58,313
Everybody out. Move.

761
00:50:15,437 --> 00:50:16,665
Thank you.

762
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,406
So who are you?

763
00:50:19,574 --> 00:50:23,010
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

764
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:24,839
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

765
00:50:25,013 --> 00:50:28,346
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

766
00:50:28,517 --> 00:50:31,214
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

767
00:50:31,387 --> 00:50:33,480
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

768
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:37,023
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

769
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:50,003
The light's nice here in the morning.

770
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:57,607
So do you wanna talk about last night?

771
00:51:04,254 --> 00:51:07,782
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

772
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:15,299
It's actually quite common.

773
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:17,059
I gotta go to work.

774
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:28,109
Do you lie?

775
00:51:29,515 --> 00:51:32,006
Why? Do you?

776
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:33,879
No, I'm asking if you lie.

777
00:51:34,954 --> 00:51:37,354
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

778
00:51:37,523 --> 00:51:39,616
Yeah, you lie.

779
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:40,952
You lie.

780
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,786
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

781
00:51:43,964 --> 00:51:46,023
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

782
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:51,626
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

783
00:51:55,075 --> 00:51:57,066
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

784
00:52:00,948 --> 00:52:02,677
Did you?

785
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,477
No.

786
00:52:06,788 --> 00:52:08,551
Let's keep it with you.

787
00:52:08,723 --> 00:52:11,317
Talk about how you feel.

788
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:15,425
<i>How I feel.</i>

789
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:17,496
<i>How I feel.</i>

790
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:40,083
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

791
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:48,296
No. Please. No.

792
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,262
Ain't gonna hurt you.

793
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,101
<i>You sit there...</i>

794
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:57,502
...with a mass murderer.

795
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,470
A mass murderer.

796
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:02,840
Your heart rate is jacked.

797
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,643
And your hand...

798
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,717
...steady.

799
00:53:11,122 --> 00:53:15,423
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

800
00:53:15,594 --> 00:53:17,789
...does not shake.

801
00:53:18,597 --> 00:53:20,087
Ever.

802
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,067
Wake the fuck up.

803
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:35,537
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

804
00:53:35,948 --> 00:53:37,916
How did you know he was a cop?

805
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:42,885
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

806
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:45,216
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

807
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:48,588
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

808
00:53:48,761 --> 00:53:51,993
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

809
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:54,527
Should I?

810
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:58,168
So do they all come in here...

811
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:00,568
...and cry, your cops?

812
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:04,043
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

813
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:07,408
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

814
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:09,709
Use their weapons?

815
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:11,718
Let me tell you something.

816
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:14,184
They signed up to use their weapons.

817
00:54:14,355 --> 00:54:16,823
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

818
00:54:16,991 --> 00:54:19,892
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

819
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:23,087
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

820
00:54:23,264 --> 00:54:25,061
Except for a cop on TV.

821
00:54:32,508 --> 00:54:34,408
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

822
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:38,104
I see that you have a record of assault.

823
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,804
Yeah.

824
00:54:40,082 --> 00:54:42,107
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

825
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:46,751
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

826
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:48,754
Did something happen to you?

827
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,558
No.

828
00:54:52,762 --> 00:54:57,222
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

829
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,801
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

830
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:03,873
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

831
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,407
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

832
00:55:06,577 --> 00:55:08,169
It's been a year. I've had enough!

833
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,474
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

834
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:14,777
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

835
00:55:14,952 --> 00:55:17,318
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

836
00:55:17,488 --> 00:55:21,050
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

837
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:23,251
How about we just erase your file, huh?

838
00:55:23,428 --> 00:55:25,191
How about we erase your file...

839
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,798
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

840
00:55:27,966 --> 00:55:31,197
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

841
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,965
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

842
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,267
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

843
00:55:37,442 --> 00:55:39,673
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

844
00:55:39,846 --> 00:55:45,216
...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

845
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:49,287
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

846
00:55:50,056 --> 00:55:52,149
For chrissake, be smart.

847
00:55:52,325 --> 00:55:55,624
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

848
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:57,354
Come on, get in the car.

849
00:55:57,531 --> 00:55:59,897
Both of you, get in the car.

850
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:03,864
When are you gonna take Costello?

851
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:06,165
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

852
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,639
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

853
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,505
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

854
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:14,615
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

855
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:18,480
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

856
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:20,348
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

857
00:56:20,522 --> 00:56:22,285
Will you shut up?

858
00:56:22,457 --> 00:56:24,823
We are building a case and it takes time.

859
00:56:24,993 --> 00:56:26,221
You know that.

860
00:56:27,529 --> 00:56:29,394
Something's wrong.

861
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:31,997
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

862
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:35,595
Yeah, maybe.

863
00:56:36,172 --> 00:56:38,902
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

864
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:41,071
No bullshit.

865
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,773
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

866
00:56:47,683 --> 00:56:49,207
You serious?

867
00:56:49,385 --> 00:56:51,183
I'm afraid so.

868
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:57,752
Have you heard anything like that?

869
00:56:57,928 --> 00:56:59,589
Jesus Christ.

870
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:03,629
Hang tight for me, kid.

871
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,597
Just a little while longer.

872
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:08,067
We are this close:

873
00:57:10,141 --> 00:57:11,870
All right?

874
00:57:13,177 --> 00:57:14,906
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

875
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:17,877
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

876
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:20,974
But now that you're here...

877
00:57:21,252 --> 00:57:23,049
...what do you want?

878
00:57:23,454 --> 00:57:24,887
You want the truth?

879
00:57:27,192 --> 00:57:28,750
Valium.

880
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:32,222
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

881
00:57:32,398 --> 00:57:35,799
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

882
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:39,665
...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

883
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:44,172
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

884
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:45,936
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

885
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:47,636
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

886
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:50,510
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

887
00:57:50,683 --> 00:57:52,514
...and you're gonna close my file?

888
00:57:52,685 --> 00:57:56,314
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

889
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:59,083
...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

890
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:03,390
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

891
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:04,553
...and what do you do?

892
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:08,793
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

893
00:58:09,336 --> 00:58:11,702
You're fucking ridiculous.

894
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,278
Two pills?

895
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,311
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

896
00:58:24,486 --> 00:58:26,647
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

897
00:58:26,822 --> 00:58:29,814
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

898
00:58:29,991 --> 00:58:32,391
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

899
00:58:32,561 --> 00:58:36,998
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

900
00:58:38,366 --> 00:58:39,994
<i>Fuck.</i>

901
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:51,373
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

902
00:58:51,547 --> 00:58:53,344
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

903
00:58:53,516 --> 00:58:55,416
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

904
00:58:55,585 --> 00:59:00,683
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

905
00:59:00,858 --> 00:59:03,725
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

906
00:59:05,762 --> 00:59:07,320
What's this?

907
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,631
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

908
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:12,359
Yeah?

909
00:59:12,536 --> 00:59:14,163
Is it enough to commit suicide?

910
00:59:14,739 --> 00:59:17,230
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

911
00:59:17,408 --> 00:59:19,569
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

912
00:59:19,744 --> 00:59:23,475
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

913
00:59:23,648 --> 00:59:27,277
You know, and too damn bad
if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

914
00:59:27,452 --> 00:59:28,714
Thank you.

915
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:32,514
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

916
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:34,682
- Good.
- Okay.

917
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:38,421
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

918
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:48,138
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

919
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:49,672
Come on in.

920
00:59:50,777 --> 00:59:54,770
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

921
00:59:54,948 --> 00:59:56,540
Yes, those.

922
00:59:56,716 --> 01:00:00,447
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

923
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,145
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

924
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:05,587
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

925
01:00:05,792 --> 01:00:09,354
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

926
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,395
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

927
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,626
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

928
01:00:14,802 --> 01:00:16,167
Our unit will not take action.

929
01:00:16,804 --> 01:00:20,672
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

930
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:23,036
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

931
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:27,170
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

932
01:00:28,016 --> 01:00:30,951
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

933
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,644
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

934
01:00:33,822 --> 01:00:36,586
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

935
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,090
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

936
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,286
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

937
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:46,026
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

938
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,267
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

939
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:55,604
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

940
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:58,269
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

941
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:01,015
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

942
01:01:01,317 --> 01:01:04,685
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

943
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:07,016
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

944
01:01:10,494 --> 01:01:13,327
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

945
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:15,994
Your mother will be proud.

946
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:18,031
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

947
01:01:18,335 --> 01:01:20,826
The readiness is all.

948
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:25,474
You know the players. Call the game.

949
01:01:27,245 --> 01:01:28,405
Thank you.

950
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:31,582
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

951
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,913
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

952
01:01:35,086 --> 01:01:37,816
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

953
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:40,925
A confessional seal, these days...

954
01:01:41,093 --> 01:01:42,720
...I'm not so sure.

955
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,430
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

956
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,100
All cell-phone signals
are under surveillance...

957
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:56,036
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

958
01:01:58,545 --> 01:02:02,345
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

959
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:06,712
Keep an eye on this one.

960
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,154
All right, here we go.

961
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,127
There's Costello. Mr. French.

962
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,127
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

963
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,332
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

964
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,377
Time is 10:46.

965
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,506
All right, turn off your cell phones.

966
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:09,676
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

967
01:03:32,444 --> 01:03:35,470
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

968
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:37,547
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

969
01:03:37,716 --> 01:03:40,446
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

970
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:43,679
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

971
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:53,057
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

972
01:03:53,466 --> 01:03:57,095
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

973
01:04:10,818 --> 01:04:13,343
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

974
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:16,654
Government man. Scared.

975
01:04:17,057 --> 01:04:20,754
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

976
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:24,330
...to come to a business transaction...

977
01:04:24,632 --> 01:04:26,395
...with automatic weapons.

978
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:36,210
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

979
01:04:36,377 --> 01:04:39,005
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

980
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,480
Because here, in this country...

981
01:04:42,918 --> 01:04:45,443
...it don't add inches to your dick.

982
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:47,816
You get a life sentence for it.

983
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:08,743
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

984
01:05:08,912 --> 01:05:11,073
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cell phones.

985
01:05:11,581 --> 01:05:13,776
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

986
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:16,351
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

987
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,987
Then narrow the area.

988
01:05:18,155 --> 01:05:20,715
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

989
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:22,792
Why did they turn their phones off?

990
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,929
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

991
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:39,975
The buyers are there.

992
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:47,016
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

993
01:05:47,185 --> 01:05:48,675
Not to my guy.

994
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:51,951
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

995
01:05:52,325 --> 01:05:53,587
Oh, who the fuck are you?

996
01:05:54,127 --> 01:05:57,255
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

997
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,733
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

998
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:08,169
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

999
01:06:13,314 --> 01:06:16,750
What we generally do, in this country...

1000
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:19,047
...is one guy...

1001
01:06:19,353 --> 01:06:21,412
...brings the items...

1002
01:06:21,588 --> 01:06:23,886
...and the other guy...

1003
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:25,488
...pays him.

1004
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:31,289
No "tickee"...

1005
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,130
...no laundry.

1006
01:06:42,577 --> 01:06:44,670
Go ahead, Fitz.

1007
01:07:00,796 --> 01:07:03,788
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1008
01:07:05,502 --> 01:07:07,561
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1009
01:07:07,738 --> 01:07:12,801
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1010
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:20,316
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1011
01:07:26,157 --> 01:07:28,387
Did you put a camera in the back?

1012
01:07:30,094 --> 01:07:32,324
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1013
01:07:34,665 --> 01:07:36,895
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1014
01:07:37,735 --> 01:07:39,259
You fucked this whole thing up!

1015
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:42,703
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1016
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:46,140
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1017
01:07:46,478 --> 01:07:48,673
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1018
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:51,077
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1019
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,242
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1020
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,445
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1021
01:07:56,622 --> 01:07:59,251
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1022
01:07:59,426 --> 01:08:02,259
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1023
01:08:02,429 --> 01:08:03,896
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1024
01:08:04,064 --> 01:08:07,124
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1025
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,463
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1026
01:08:10,637 --> 01:08:14,664
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1027
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:18,369
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1028
01:08:18,546 --> 01:08:23,006
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1029
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:25,652
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1030
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,685
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1031
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:30,915
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1032
01:08:31,092 --> 01:08:34,186
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1033
01:08:40,202 --> 01:08:43,365
- changing your life radically.

1034
01:08:43,538 --> 01:08:45,938
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1035
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:48,133
- Right?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:51,046 --> 01:08:53,413
How long you been with this guy?

1037
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,878
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1038
01:08:59,589 --> 01:09:02,786
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1039
01:09:02,959 --> 01:09:04,483
Do you love him?

1040
01:09:06,662 --> 01:09:09,130
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1041
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:10,663
It's very serious.

1042
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:14,531
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1043
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:17,164
No more than I am.

1044
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:19,799
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1045
01:09:20,444 --> 01:09:22,674
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1046
01:09:22,846 --> 01:09:25,178
People have doubts and problems.

1047
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:29,313
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1048
01:09:32,056 --> 01:09:35,822
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1049
01:09:40,832 --> 01:09:44,199
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1050
01:09:44,369 --> 01:09:47,897
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1051
01:09:48,073 --> 01:09:50,166
Right? We talked about that.

1052
01:09:55,714 --> 01:09:57,682
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1053
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,275
Want a French doughnut?

1054
01:10:00,786 --> 01:10:02,253
Yeah.

1055
01:10:03,689 --> 01:10:05,282
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1056
01:10:05,692 --> 01:10:06,920
Sure.

1057
01:10:09,563 --> 01:10:12,191
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1058
01:10:12,365 --> 01:10:14,526
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1059
01:10:15,001 --> 01:10:16,468
Look, I respect who you are...

1060
01:10:16,636 --> 01:10:18,797
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1061
01:10:18,972 --> 01:10:20,564
We might have company.

1062
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,731
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1063
01:10:23,477 --> 01:10:26,878
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1064
01:10:27,048 --> 01:10:30,745
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1065
01:10:31,118 --> 01:10:32,107
Yeah?

1066
01:10:33,094 --> 01:10:34,946
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1067
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:38,641
Because I believe in public service.

1068
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:43,788
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1069
01:10:44,558 --> 01:10:47,026
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1070
01:10:47,761 --> 01:10:50,321
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1071
01:10:50,497 --> 01:10:52,192
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1072
01:10:52,366 --> 01:10:53,833
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1073
01:10:54,101 --> 01:10:56,228
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1074
01:10:56,403 --> 01:10:58,598
You live here now. You're a resident.

1075
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:02,304
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1076
01:11:02,477 --> 01:11:05,275
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1077
01:11:05,747 --> 01:11:07,044
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1078
01:11:07,215 --> 01:11:08,739
What?

1079
01:11:09,217 --> 01:11:11,344
I think it's a guy with...

1080
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:15,512
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1081
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,854
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1082
01:11:20,696 --> 01:11:22,061
Something for work.

1083
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:26,099
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1084
01:11:26,302 --> 01:11:28,566
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1085
01:11:28,738 --> 01:11:31,366
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1086
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,235
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1087
01:11:33,409 --> 01:11:37,141
- You better get organized, quick.
- Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1088
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:39,145
...and you're not in jail.

1089
01:11:39,316 --> 01:11:42,717
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1090
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:46,617
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1091
01:11:49,326 --> 01:11:50,691
Yes. Yes, I do.

1092
01:11:50,861 --> 01:11:52,488
So earn it.

1093
01:11:53,363 --> 01:11:55,423
I'm getting the feeling...

1094
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,500
...we got a cop in my crew.

1095
01:11:57,802 --> 01:12:00,202
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1096
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:03,169
He's one of yours. Inside.

1097
01:12:03,341 --> 01:12:04,433
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1098
01:12:04,609 --> 01:12:08,204
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1099
01:12:08,379 --> 01:12:09,573
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1100
01:12:09,747 --> 01:12:12,615
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1101
01:12:12,785 --> 01:12:14,343
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1102
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,388
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1103
01:12:18,557 --> 01:12:22,015
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1104
01:12:22,194 --> 01:12:24,128
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1105
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:28,460
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1106
01:12:28,634 --> 01:12:31,900
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1107
01:12:32,072 --> 01:12:35,269
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1108
01:12:35,442 --> 01:12:39,970
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1109
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:41,943
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1110
01:12:42,115 --> 01:12:44,549
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1111
01:12:44,717 --> 01:12:46,912
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1112
01:12:47,087 --> 01:12:48,817
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1113
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:52,152
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1114
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:55,625
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1115
01:12:55,796 --> 01:12:58,287
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1116
01:13:05,106 --> 01:13:07,473
How are you, Francis?

1117
01:13:12,647 --> 01:13:16,139
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1118
01:13:16,318 --> 01:13:19,116
And your father called you the tumor.

1119
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:21,949
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1120
01:13:22,124 --> 01:13:26,118
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1121
01:13:26,295 --> 01:13:28,422
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1122
01:13:28,598 --> 01:13:32,500
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1123
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:34,659
You're lying to me.

1124
01:13:36,439 --> 01:13:37,804
Not exactly.

1125
01:13:37,974 --> 01:13:41,432
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1126
01:13:41,878 --> 01:13:44,575
Microprocessors.

1127
01:13:45,082 --> 01:13:46,310
Oh, yeah.

1128
01:13:46,483 --> 01:13:49,646
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1129
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:53,153
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1130
01:13:54,858 --> 01:13:57,691
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1131
01:13:58,362 --> 01:14:01,025
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1132
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:05,158
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1133
01:14:05,537 --> 01:14:10,304
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1134
01:14:10,475 --> 01:14:12,500
...or your life.

1135
01:14:13,478 --> 01:14:16,470
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1136
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:18,845
Okay, then just say that.

1137
01:14:20,933 --> 01:14:22,298
All right, I will.

1138
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:25,096
Oh, that's the movers.

1139
01:14:25,271 --> 01:14:27,034
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1140
01:14:28,007 --> 01:14:30,168
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1141
01:14:30,343 --> 01:14:33,972
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1142
01:14:34,414 --> 01:14:36,383
I'm gonna get you.

1143
01:14:37,584 --> 01:14:40,417
If you could've, you would've.

1144
01:14:40,688 --> 01:14:44,249
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1145
01:14:44,425 --> 01:14:48,794
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1146
01:14:56,838 --> 01:14:57,827
<i>Frankie.</i>

1147
01:14:58,773 --> 01:15:00,240
<i>Frankie!</i>

1148
01:15:01,109 --> 01:15:03,202
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1149
01:15:07,982 --> 01:15:09,847
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1150
01:15:10,018 --> 01:15:12,043
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1151
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:15,054
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1152
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:19,627
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1153
01:15:19,795 --> 01:15:22,286
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1154
01:15:25,735 --> 01:15:27,259
My God, is that French out there?

1155
01:15:27,436 --> 01:15:29,597
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1156
01:15:29,772 --> 01:15:31,707
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1157
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:34,866
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1158
01:15:35,045 --> 01:15:38,811
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1159
01:15:39,082 --> 01:15:41,243
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1160
01:15:41,418 --> 01:15:45,320
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1161
01:15:46,156 --> 01:15:47,145
Fuck!

1162
01:15:47,324 --> 01:15:50,624
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1163
01:15:50,795 --> 01:15:54,754
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1164
01:15:54,932 --> 01:15:57,423
He'll trade you out.

1165
01:15:57,802 --> 01:16:00,498
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1166
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:03,765
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1167
01:16:03,941 --> 01:16:06,934
It fucking hurts!

1168
01:16:14,453 --> 01:16:16,683
Hey. It's me.

1169
01:16:16,855 --> 01:16:19,187
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1170
01:16:21,393 --> 01:16:24,157
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1171
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:28,630
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1172
01:16:28,802 --> 01:16:31,168
He's a protected fucking informant.

1173
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:35,569
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1174
01:16:36,743 --> 01:16:39,371
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1175
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:46,450
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1176
01:16:51,525 --> 01:16:53,220
That's my son, Patrick.

1177
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:56,655
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1178
01:16:56,831 --> 01:17:00,198
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1179
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:01,858
No. No, thanks.

1180
01:17:02,037 --> 01:17:05,632
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1181
01:17:05,807 --> 01:17:07,434
Come on.

1182
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,208
You want some coke?

1183
01:17:49,753 --> 01:17:51,653
There it is.

1184
01:17:52,289 --> 01:17:54,780
Don't move till you're numb.

1185
01:18:09,807 --> 01:18:11,741
Come on. Get inside.

1186
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:15,910
Boss wants your real name...

1187
01:18:16,615 --> 01:18:19,607
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1188
01:18:19,785 --> 01:18:21,878
I don't have a bank account.

1189
01:18:22,054 --> 01:18:25,251
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1190
01:18:25,424 --> 01:18:29,360
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1191
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:31,360
Then we wait here.

1192
01:18:32,198 --> 01:18:34,928
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1193
01:18:46,313 --> 01:18:48,440
Put the forms in there.

1194
01:18:51,953 --> 01:18:54,319
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1195
01:18:54,488 --> 01:18:57,150
But fuck it, you know?

1196
01:18:57,658 --> 01:19:00,126
No, no, no. Come here.

1197
01:19:05,099 --> 01:19:07,090
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1198
01:19:07,269 --> 01:19:09,430
That ain't fucking right.

1199
01:19:09,604 --> 01:19:10,866
Are you kidding me?

1200
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,336
Look at this. Look.

1201
01:19:13,108 --> 01:19:15,099
"Citizens." Look.

1202
01:19:15,444 --> 01:19:16,775
Billy, he said to stay here.

1203
01:19:17,145 --> 01:19:19,670
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1204
01:19:19,848 --> 01:19:21,213
Where the fuck are you going?

1205
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:25,548
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1206
01:19:44,875 --> 01:19:46,900
- Hey.
- Hi.

1207
01:19:48,946 --> 01:19:51,005
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1208
01:19:57,921 --> 01:19:59,786
Look...

1209
01:19:59,957 --> 01:20:01,721
...if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1210
01:20:01,893 --> 01:20:04,521
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1211
01:20:07,365 --> 01:20:09,333
So you moving out or you moving in?

1212
01:20:10,101 --> 01:20:12,262
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1213
01:20:21,447 --> 01:20:23,108
That's me.

1214
01:20:26,185 --> 01:20:27,675
Yeah, I know.

1215
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:37,456
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1216
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:39,230
You have to choose.

1217
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:42,061
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1218
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:45,636
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1219
01:20:45,806 --> 01:20:48,070
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1220
01:20:48,241 --> 01:20:50,835
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1221
01:20:51,778 --> 01:20:54,679
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1222
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:10,726
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1223
01:21:15,938 --> 01:21:17,599
Is it real?

1224
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:23,239
I think so.

1225
01:21:29,151 --> 01:21:31,016
You don't have any cats.

1226
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,745
No.

1227
01:21:33,723 --> 01:21:35,486
I like that.

1228
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:48,995
I don't get it.

1229
01:22:51,905 --> 01:22:54,533
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1230
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:57,871
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1231
01:22:58,045 --> 01:23:02,278
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1232
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:06,614
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1233
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:10,053
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:10,225 --> 01:23:13,558
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1235
01:23:13,728 --> 01:23:15,195
I have an immaculate record.

1236
01:23:16,464 --> 01:23:18,329
How is your wedding coming along?

1237
01:23:18,499 --> 01:23:20,934
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1238
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:23,870
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1239
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:26,166
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1240
01:23:26,342 --> 01:23:29,243
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1241
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:32,073
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1242
01:23:32,248 --> 01:23:36,309
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1243
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:39,554
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1244
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,720
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1245
01:24:30,809 --> 01:24:34,473
Be dirty, be dirty.

1246
01:24:36,649 --> 01:24:38,844
Yeah...

1247
01:24:44,057 --> 01:24:46,787
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1248
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:50,687
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1249
01:24:50,864 --> 01:24:53,765
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1250
01:24:53,934 --> 01:24:57,995
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1251
01:24:58,372 --> 01:25:00,067
You're not cracking up, are you?

1252
01:25:01,008 --> 01:25:03,568
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1253
01:25:03,744 --> 01:25:05,644
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1254
01:25:05,813 --> 01:25:08,977
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1255
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:11,245
I own the place.

1256
01:25:13,555 --> 01:25:16,149
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1257
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:21,223
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1258
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:23,397
How the fuck do you know that?

1259
01:25:23,565 --> 01:25:25,863
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1260
01:25:26,034 --> 01:25:29,596
I gotta find myself.

1261
01:25:29,772 --> 01:25:31,364
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1262
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:34,374
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1263
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:38,740
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1264
01:25:38,914 --> 01:25:40,973
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1265
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:45,588
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1266
01:25:45,756 --> 01:25:47,587
- Right now.
- Collie...

1267
01:25:47,758 --> 01:25:50,158
...laying low is not what I do.

1268
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:52,989
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1269
01:25:53,163 --> 01:25:55,393
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1270
01:25:55,565 --> 01:25:57,157
What good am I if you don't listen?

1271
01:26:02,305 --> 01:26:05,104
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1272
01:26:05,276 --> 01:26:06,937
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1273
01:26:07,111 --> 01:26:10,706
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1274
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,412
Okay.

1275
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:22,125
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1276
01:26:22,294 --> 01:26:26,321
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1277
01:26:26,498 --> 01:26:30,730
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1278
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:34,161
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1279
01:26:34,339 --> 01:26:39,505
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1280
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,113
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1281
01:26:42,649 --> 01:26:45,015
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1282
01:26:46,252 --> 01:26:50,814
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1283
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,651
Right?

1284
01:26:52,826 --> 01:26:55,454
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1285
01:26:55,628 --> 01:27:00,259
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1286
01:27:06,774 --> 01:27:08,332
Christ.

1287
01:27:10,478 --> 01:27:13,003
Who knows what's easy?

1288
01:27:13,781 --> 01:27:18,446
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1289
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,667
Shit!

1290
01:28:43,576 --> 01:28:45,009
Fuck.

1291
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,650
Hey, how you doing?

1292
01:30:04,828 --> 01:30:06,989
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1293
01:30:11,168 --> 01:30:13,033
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1294
01:30:13,203 --> 01:30:14,898
Have a good one.

1295
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:40,191
I smell a rat.

1296
01:30:46,839 --> 01:30:48,067
Jesus Christ.

1297
01:30:49,141 --> 01:30:50,733
You got a girlfriend?

1298
01:30:52,679 --> 01:30:54,340
No.

1299
01:30:54,514 --> 01:30:56,573
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1300
01:30:58,318 --> 01:30:59,683
It depends.

1301
01:31:01,888 --> 01:31:05,517
I'm sure by now you know...

1302
01:31:06,126 --> 01:31:09,254
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1303
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,459
Cop.

1304
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:16,899
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1305
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:19,232
Jesus Christ.

1306
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,470
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1307
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:27,813
It ain't the FBI.

1308
01:31:28,851 --> 01:31:30,785
Ex-wife.

1309
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:34,146
Old girlfriend.

1310
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:37,458
Or stupid.

1311
01:31:38,627 --> 01:31:41,994
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1312
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,859
Stupid, huh?

1313
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:46,434
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1314
01:31:50,673 --> 01:31:56,043
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1315
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:59,214
Everybody who works for me.

1316
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:01,980
Right. You know, Frank...

1317
01:32:02,152 --> 01:32:04,246
...I look around at your other guys...

1318
01:32:05,055 --> 01:32:07,990
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1319
01:32:08,659 --> 01:32:11,822
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1320
01:32:13,898 --> 01:32:17,061
And all I can answer myself is:

1321
01:32:18,569 --> 01:32:20,594
"What's the difference?"

1322
01:32:21,338 --> 01:32:23,671
Give them up to the Almighty.

1323
01:32:24,209 --> 01:32:26,905
You see, that's my point, you know?

1324
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:32,173
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1325
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:33,681
You accuse me twice...

1326
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,220
...I quit.

1327
01:32:37,823 --> 01:32:42,227
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1328
01:32:42,395 --> 01:32:45,330
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1329
01:32:56,475 --> 01:33:00,139
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1330
01:33:02,282 --> 01:33:06,309
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1331
01:33:07,187 --> 01:33:09,485
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1332
01:33:09,656 --> 01:33:11,988
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1333
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:14,457
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1334
01:33:14,628 --> 01:33:18,224
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1335
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:20,526
I haven't needed the money...

1336
01:33:20,702 --> 01:33:24,832
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1337
01:33:25,006 --> 01:33:28,271
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1338
01:33:29,744 --> 01:33:31,575
But I like it.

1339
01:33:32,747 --> 01:33:35,512
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1340
01:33:35,684 --> 01:33:38,517
...I got this rat...

1341
01:33:38,687 --> 01:33:42,987
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1342
01:33:43,158 --> 01:33:45,558
...and it brings up questions.

1343
01:33:45,728 --> 01:33:49,721
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1344
01:33:50,966 --> 01:33:52,798
Girlfriend...

1345
01:33:54,638 --> 01:33:59,507
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1346
01:34:00,277 --> 01:34:02,939
Social-security numbers.

1347
01:34:03,113 --> 01:34:06,048
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1348
01:34:06,216 --> 01:34:09,014
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1349
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,586
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1350
01:34:11,756 --> 01:34:13,690
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1351
01:34:13,858 --> 01:34:17,157
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1352
01:34:17,328 --> 01:34:18,727
I'm not the fucking rat.

1353
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:22,162
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1354
01:34:23,067 --> 01:34:24,591
You said there is one, all right?

1355
01:34:24,769 --> 01:34:28,296
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1356
01:34:28,472 --> 01:34:30,566
Sure. Sure, Will.

1357
01:34:30,742 --> 01:34:35,236
You, William. What would you do?

1358
01:34:40,252 --> 01:34:41,776
Frank, how many of these guys...

1359
01:34:41,954 --> 01:34:44,354
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1360
01:34:44,523 --> 01:34:47,493
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1361
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:50,629
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1362
01:34:50,797 --> 01:34:54,324
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1363
01:34:55,168 --> 01:34:59,662
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1364
01:35:00,606 --> 01:35:03,769
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1365
01:35:05,045 --> 01:35:08,481
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1366
01:35:10,985 --> 01:35:13,010
You wanna be me?

1367
01:35:16,724 --> 01:35:19,386
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1368
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,050
Yeah, I know that much.

1369
01:35:22,363 --> 01:35:25,424
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1370
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,864
I don't wanna be you.

1371
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:33,807
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1372
01:35:34,309 --> 01:35:35,742
Yeah.

1373
01:35:36,578 --> 01:35:39,046
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1374
01:35:39,214 --> 01:35:43,311
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1375
01:35:45,821 --> 01:35:48,688
You know what I like about restaurants?

1376
01:35:48,858 --> 01:35:50,723
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1377
01:35:51,227 --> 01:35:55,129
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1378
01:35:57,366 --> 01:35:59,699
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1379
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:03,503
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1380
01:36:03,673 --> 01:36:06,836
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1381
01:36:11,014 --> 01:36:16,247
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1382
01:36:17,087 --> 01:36:19,352
I got it. Okay?

1383
01:36:21,726 --> 01:36:23,284
Excuse me...

1384
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:26,123
...French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1385
01:36:26,297 --> 01:36:27,286
...cigarette.

1386
01:36:30,268 --> 01:36:32,600
Eat something.

1387
01:36:41,246 --> 01:36:42,235
Problem?

1388
01:36:42,414 --> 01:36:45,941
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1389
01:36:46,118 --> 01:36:48,450
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1390
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,747
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1391
01:36:50,923 --> 01:36:54,451
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1392
01:36:54,627 --> 01:36:58,188
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1393
01:36:58,364 --> 01:36:59,353
Fucking prick.

1394
01:36:59,766 --> 01:37:02,758
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1395
01:37:02,936 --> 01:37:05,268
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1396
01:37:05,605 --> 01:37:08,938
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1397
01:37:09,709 --> 01:37:12,304
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1398
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:16,841
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1399
01:37:18,586 --> 01:37:21,487
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1400
01:37:23,824 --> 01:37:27,089
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1401
01:37:27,261 --> 01:37:30,026
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1402
01:37:30,198 --> 01:37:31,426
No.

1403
01:37:33,902 --> 01:37:36,803
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1404
01:37:37,572 --> 01:37:41,269
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1405
01:37:41,443 --> 01:37:43,308
...who is here in SIU.

1406
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:47,446
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1407
01:37:55,091 --> 01:37:57,719
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1408
01:37:57,927 --> 01:38:02,159
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1409
01:38:02,331 --> 01:38:07,133
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1410
01:38:08,572 --> 01:38:10,563
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1411
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:16,741
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1412
01:38:17,381 --> 01:38:20,316
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1413
01:38:20,918 --> 01:38:23,079
...I'd be through it in a year.

1414
01:38:24,389 --> 01:38:26,289
If I wasn't a trooper.

1415
01:38:30,595 --> 01:38:33,428
But another city. I was thinking that.

1416
01:38:34,666 --> 01:38:36,395
Another city.

1417
01:38:36,634 --> 01:38:38,966
Another city, huh?

1418
01:38:40,471 --> 01:38:43,600
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1419
01:38:44,143 --> 01:38:47,408
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1420
01:38:49,748 --> 01:38:51,545
If we're not gonna make it...

1421
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:56,177
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1422
01:38:57,489 --> 01:39:01,824
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1423
01:39:10,604 --> 01:39:14,438
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1424
01:39:32,693 --> 01:39:35,457
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1425
01:39:35,630 --> 01:39:38,657
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1426
01:39:38,834 --> 01:39:42,099
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1427
01:39:42,271 --> 01:39:43,260
Yeah.

1428
01:39:43,438 --> 01:39:47,135
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1429
01:39:47,776 --> 01:39:50,609
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1430
01:39:56,552 --> 01:39:58,520
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1431
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:03,820
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1432
01:40:05,595 --> 01:40:07,927
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1433
01:40:08,097 --> 01:40:10,395
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1434
01:40:21,912 --> 01:40:25,939
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1435
01:40:27,685 --> 01:40:32,316
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1436
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:36,688
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1437
01:40:37,462 --> 01:40:40,022
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1438
01:40:41,032 --> 01:40:43,125
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1439
01:40:43,301 --> 01:40:45,599
...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1440
01:40:48,006 --> 01:40:49,634
You're a cop.

1441
01:40:50,109 --> 01:40:51,440
What?

1442
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:53,737
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1443
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:58,511
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1444
01:40:59,952 --> 01:41:03,080
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1445
01:41:03,255 --> 01:41:05,189
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1446
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:15,092
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1447
01:41:15,268 --> 01:41:18,465
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1448
01:41:18,638 --> 01:41:21,937
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1449
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:23,542
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1450
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:26,077
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1451
01:41:26,247 --> 01:41:29,705
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1452
01:41:29,884 --> 01:41:33,650
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1453
01:41:35,523 --> 01:41:37,150
It ain't Bill.

1454
01:41:37,325 --> 01:41:39,088
No way, he says.

1455
01:41:51,607 --> 01:41:53,973
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1456
01:41:54,143 --> 01:41:55,667
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1457
01:41:55,844 --> 01:42:00,247
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1458
01:42:01,284 --> 01:42:02,979
Good. Thank you.

1459
01:42:05,822 --> 01:42:09,758
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1460
01:42:09,926 --> 01:42:11,826
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1461
01:42:11,995 --> 01:42:15,158
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1462
01:42:15,331 --> 01:42:19,098
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1463
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:21,261
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1464
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:24,966
<i>- I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1465
01:42:25,142 --> 01:42:27,872
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1466
01:42:28,045 --> 01:42:30,343
So just follow him and don't get made.

1467
01:42:33,684 --> 01:42:36,551
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1468
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:14,254
Hey. Where are you?

1469
01:43:14,428 --> 01:43:16,396
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1470
01:43:17,798 --> 01:43:20,266
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1471
01:43:20,434 --> 01:43:22,299
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1472
01:43:22,803 --> 01:43:24,202
No.

1473
01:43:25,839 --> 01:43:28,672
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1474
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:33,640
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1475
01:43:33,815 --> 01:43:36,079
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1476
01:44:12,022 --> 01:44:15,219
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1477
01:44:15,392 --> 01:44:17,917
You got that? 344 Wash.

1478
01:44:22,098 --> 01:44:23,725
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1479
01:44:28,306 --> 01:44:30,968
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1480
01:44:32,476 --> 01:44:35,775
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1481
01:44:36,614 --> 01:44:38,104
He's getting spooky, captain.

1482
01:44:38,282 --> 01:44:39,408
- What?
- I just saw him.

1483
01:44:39,584 --> 01:44:42,109
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1484
01:44:48,694 --> 01:44:51,128
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1485
01:44:51,763 --> 01:44:54,732
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1486
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:58,427
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1487
01:44:58,604 --> 01:45:00,936
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1488
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:10,749
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1489
01:45:10,917 --> 01:45:12,612
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1490
01:45:12,785 --> 01:45:15,583
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1491
01:45:15,755 --> 01:45:19,020
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1492
01:45:20,094 --> 01:45:21,152
Yeah?

1493
01:45:21,328 --> 01:45:24,024
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1494
01:45:24,198 --> 01:45:26,530
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1495
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:28,133
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1496
01:45:32,172 --> 01:45:33,332
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1497
01:45:33,507 --> 01:45:35,805
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1498
01:45:36,276 --> 01:45:38,268
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1499
01:45:38,446 --> 01:45:41,040
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1500
01:45:41,216 --> 01:45:42,649
All right, we'll see you there.

1501
01:45:43,184 --> 01:45:44,412
- What?
- You were followed.

1502
01:45:44,586 --> 01:45:46,178
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1503
01:45:46,354 --> 01:45:47,787
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1504
01:45:47,956 --> 01:45:50,686
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1505
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:53,184
Come on!

1506
01:45:59,835 --> 01:46:02,303
What the fuck is going on?

1507
01:46:03,406 --> 01:46:06,239
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1508
01:46:07,143 --> 01:46:09,577
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1509
01:46:09,745 --> 01:46:13,044
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1510
01:46:17,988 --> 01:46:20,821
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1511
01:46:24,895 --> 01:46:26,692
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1512
01:46:26,863 --> 01:46:28,694
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1513
01:46:28,865 --> 01:46:31,892
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1514
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:52,081
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1515
01:46:52,257 --> 01:46:55,283
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:46:55,461 --> 01:46:57,554
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1517
01:46:57,730 --> 01:46:59,755
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1518
01:47:16,082 --> 01:47:19,074
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1519
01:47:23,423 --> 01:47:25,448
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1520
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,319
What the fuck?

1521
01:47:31,398 --> 01:47:32,387
Fuck.

1522
01:47:32,566 --> 01:47:34,466
What do you mean,
off the building?

1523
01:47:34,635 --> 01:47:37,331
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1524
01:47:46,047 --> 01:47:47,947
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1525
01:47:48,116 --> 01:47:50,880
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1526
01:47:51,486 --> 01:47:52,976
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1527
01:47:53,155 --> 01:47:54,952
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1528
01:47:55,123 --> 01:47:56,488
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1529
01:47:56,658 --> 01:47:58,319
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1530
01:47:58,493 --> 01:48:00,017
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1531
01:48:00,195 --> 01:48:03,131
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1532
01:48:03,299 --> 01:48:05,358
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1533
01:48:05,535 --> 01:48:07,662
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1534
01:48:07,837 --> 01:48:09,202
What came off the roof?

1535
01:48:09,372 --> 01:48:10,862
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1536
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,803
Fuck this.

1537
01:48:20,884 --> 01:48:22,511
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1538
01:48:24,021 --> 01:48:26,956
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1539
01:48:27,124 --> 01:48:28,751
All right. I got him.

1540
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,394
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1541
01:48:37,568 --> 01:48:40,970
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1542
01:48:41,139 --> 01:48:43,164
<i>Send some back...</i>

1543
01:49:00,526 --> 01:49:03,689
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1544
01:49:03,863 --> 01:49:05,694
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1545
01:49:05,865 --> 01:49:08,026
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1546
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,930
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1547
01:49:11,103 --> 01:49:13,503
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1548
01:49:14,407 --> 01:49:16,068
Fucking piece of shit!

1549
01:49:16,243 --> 01:49:17,733
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1550
01:49:17,911 --> 01:49:19,276
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1551
01:49:19,446 --> 01:49:22,609
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1552
01:49:22,782 --> 01:49:24,943
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1553
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:27,348
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1554
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,921
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1555
01:49:31,091 --> 01:49:32,183
That's a fucking lie.

1556
01:49:32,360 --> 01:49:35,921
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1557
01:49:36,097 --> 01:49:37,689
I need access to those files.

1558
01:49:37,865 --> 01:49:40,891
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1559
01:49:41,068 --> 01:49:43,195
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1560
01:49:43,371 --> 01:49:46,169
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1561
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:49,207
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1562
01:49:49,377 --> 01:49:52,313
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1563
01:49:52,481 --> 01:49:54,847
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1564
01:49:55,017 --> 01:49:58,418
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1565
01:49:58,587 --> 01:50:00,054
Good.

1566
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:03,482
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1567
01:50:05,427 --> 01:50:07,258
- I need those codes.
- No.

1568
01:50:07,429 --> 01:50:09,557
You want those codes.

1569
01:50:12,669 --> 01:50:14,398
So where the fuck were you?

1570
01:50:16,072 --> 01:50:18,632
Well, boss told me to go home.

1571
01:50:18,808 --> 01:50:23,006
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1572
01:50:23,179 --> 01:50:24,646
So where the fuck were you?

1573
01:50:25,248 --> 01:50:28,150
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1574
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:30,310
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1575
01:50:30,487 --> 01:50:33,513
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1576
01:50:33,691 --> 01:50:35,750
Billy. Billy.

1577
01:50:42,132 --> 01:50:43,656
Yeah?

1578
01:50:45,870 --> 01:50:47,861
Yeah?

1579
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,501
You know what I thought today?

1580
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:54,005
What's that?

1581
01:50:55,013 --> 01:50:58,471
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1582
01:51:01,953 --> 01:51:03,319
Yeah?

1583
01:51:04,357 --> 01:51:08,157
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1584
01:51:10,062 --> 01:51:12,292
When I called you...

1585
01:51:12,465 --> 01:51:14,695
...I made a mistake.

1586
01:51:14,867 --> 01:51:18,667
I gave you the wrong address...

1587
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:22,673
...but you showed up at the right one...

1588
01:51:23,143 --> 01:51:25,043
...didn't you?

1589
01:51:26,313 --> 01:51:28,873
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1590
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:31,481
Tell me why.

1591
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:57,777
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1592
01:51:57,946 --> 01:51:59,743
He's dead.

1593
01:51:59,915 --> 01:52:01,542
I'm going home.

1594
01:52:01,717 --> 01:52:04,515
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1595
01:52:04,686 --> 01:52:06,711
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1596
01:52:06,889 --> 01:52:08,356
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1597
01:52:08,524 --> 01:52:11,721
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1598
01:52:11,894 --> 01:52:14,556
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1599
01:52:14,730 --> 01:52:16,198
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1600
01:52:16,366 --> 01:52:20,427
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1601
01:52:20,603 --> 01:52:22,036
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1602
01:52:22,205 --> 01:52:25,868
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1603
01:52:26,042 --> 01:52:28,101
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1604
01:52:28,278 --> 01:52:31,941
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1605
01:52:33,617 --> 01:52:35,278
Sweetheart.

1606
01:52:35,453 --> 01:52:37,648
You're giving me a hard-on.

1607
01:52:38,255 --> 01:52:39,654
Are you sure it's me?

1608
01:52:40,157 --> 01:52:43,422
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1609
01:52:43,894 --> 01:52:45,885
Watch your fucking mouth.

1610
01:52:46,063 --> 01:52:48,497
No. You watch it.

1611
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,499
Let me straighten you out.

1612
01:52:59,411 --> 01:53:02,278
I tried to call you a few times.

1613
01:53:05,484 --> 01:53:07,247
I know.

1614
01:53:33,647 --> 01:53:37,549
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1615
01:53:42,689 --> 01:53:44,589
I'm sorry.

1616
01:53:51,065 --> 01:53:52,794
Yeah...

1617
01:53:57,372 --> 01:53:58,999
...I know.

1618
01:56:07,642 --> 01:56:09,132
Yeah.

1619
01:56:09,945 --> 01:56:13,176
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1620
01:56:13,616 --> 01:56:15,174
Who are you?

1621
01:56:15,418 --> 01:56:17,682
So it is you.

1622
01:56:18,888 --> 01:56:21,880
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1623
01:56:23,292 --> 01:56:24,919
Who are you?

1624
01:56:25,828 --> 01:56:27,853
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1625
01:56:28,031 --> 01:56:29,794
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1626
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:32,525
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1627
01:56:32,703 --> 01:56:34,034
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1628
01:56:34,204 --> 01:56:37,401
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1629
01:56:37,574 --> 01:56:39,769
We're all very upset.

1630
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:43,174
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1631
01:56:44,147 --> 01:56:47,049
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1632
01:56:48,519 --> 01:56:49,508
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1633
01:57:28,695 --> 01:57:30,993
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1634
01:57:31,164 --> 01:57:33,132
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1635
01:57:33,299 --> 01:57:36,291
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1636
01:57:36,469 --> 01:57:38,960
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1637
01:57:39,139 --> 01:57:42,109
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1638
01:57:42,276 --> 01:57:43,834
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1639
01:57:44,011 --> 01:57:46,411
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1640
01:57:46,580 --> 01:57:50,038
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1641
01:57:50,284 --> 01:57:53,742
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1642
01:57:53,921 --> 01:57:55,855
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1643
01:57:56,023 --> 01:57:58,652
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1644
01:57:58,827 --> 01:58:00,988
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1645
01:58:01,163 --> 01:58:03,290
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1646
01:58:03,465 --> 01:58:05,695
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1647
01:58:06,067 --> 01:58:07,364
I'm embarrassed.

1648
01:58:08,036 --> 01:58:10,698
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1649
01:58:10,872 --> 01:58:15,400
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1650
01:58:15,777 --> 01:58:17,973
...so I won't look for the cop.

1651
01:58:19,248 --> 01:58:20,875
Are you soft, Fitz?

1652
01:58:21,050 --> 01:58:26,010
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1653
01:58:26,189 --> 01:58:29,124
...you dump him in the marsh.

1654
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:33,458
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1655
01:58:33,629 --> 01:58:35,723
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1656
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,661
Don't laugh!

1657
01:58:39,503 --> 01:58:42,404
This ain't reality TV!

1658
01:58:46,343 --> 01:58:48,106
Proceed.

1659
01:59:10,569 --> 01:59:12,036
- What?
- Yeah.

1660
01:59:12,204 --> 01:59:14,968
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1661
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:18,701
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1662
01:59:18,878 --> 01:59:20,004
So get rid of them.

1663
01:59:20,179 --> 01:59:23,273
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1664
01:59:23,449 --> 01:59:25,679
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1665
01:59:30,624 --> 01:59:32,182
All right.

1666
01:59:38,498 --> 01:59:41,695
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1667
01:59:41,868 --> 01:59:44,666
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1668
02:00:00,988 --> 02:00:04,321
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1669
02:00:04,492 --> 02:00:06,859
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1670
02:00:07,029 --> 02:00:09,691
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1671
02:00:09,898 --> 02:00:11,263
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1672
02:00:11,433 --> 02:00:14,095
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1673
02:00:14,269 --> 02:00:17,204
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1674
02:00:17,406 --> 02:00:19,874
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1675
02:00:20,042 --> 02:00:22,203
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1676
02:00:22,377 --> 02:00:24,812
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1677
02:00:24,981 --> 02:00:27,973
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1678
02:00:48,339 --> 02:00:50,398
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1679
02:00:50,574 --> 02:00:53,168
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1680
02:01:17,470 --> 02:01:18,994
Load it.

1681
02:01:27,013 --> 02:01:29,311
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1682
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:32,551
Were you not in the fucking car?

1683
02:01:32,718 --> 02:01:35,779
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1684
02:01:38,992 --> 02:01:40,789
Load.

1685
02:01:48,368 --> 02:01:50,199
Go, go!

1686
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,198
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1687
02:01:56,277 --> 02:01:58,404
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1688
02:01:58,579 --> 02:02:02,037
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1689
02:02:11,059 --> 02:02:13,494
Cocksuckers.

1690
02:02:19,501 --> 02:02:22,061
Motherfucking shit!

1691
02:02:25,507 --> 02:02:27,168
Motherfucking!

1692
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:32,844
Back the fuck up!

1693
02:02:33,016 --> 02:02:35,109
They fucking shot me.

1694
02:02:38,822 --> 02:02:39,948
Get down!

1695
02:02:42,959 --> 02:02:44,517
Come on, fucking bastards!

1696
02:03:03,247 --> 02:03:04,714
Fuck it.

1697
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:47,924
How the fuck did this happen?

1698
02:03:49,329 --> 02:03:51,923
You're an FBI informant?

1699
02:03:52,099 --> 02:03:54,294
Are you fucking kidding me?

1700
02:03:55,769 --> 02:03:57,464
Grow up.

1701
02:03:58,172 --> 02:04:01,108
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1702
02:04:01,276 --> 02:04:02,766
Do they know who I am?

1703
02:04:04,712 --> 02:04:09,081
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1704
02:04:10,118 --> 02:04:12,552
Nobody knows nothing.

1705
02:04:14,155 --> 02:04:15,645
Frank.

1706
02:04:15,957 --> 02:04:18,859
Frank. Frank.

1707
02:04:19,028 --> 02:04:21,019
Do they know about me?

1708
02:04:22,731 --> 02:04:25,256
I know about you, Collie.

1709
02:04:25,434 --> 02:04:28,267
You know I'd never give you up.

1710
02:04:29,004 --> 02:04:31,768
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1711
02:04:32,675 --> 02:04:36,043
To you? Is that what this is about?

1712
02:04:37,013 --> 02:04:41,347
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1713
02:05:03,374 --> 02:05:05,808
Fucking rat prick!

1714
02:05:27,399 --> 02:05:28,991
<i>Frank?</i>

1715
02:05:29,167 --> 02:05:30,658
Yeah?

1716
02:05:32,405 --> 02:05:33,633
Who's this?

1717
02:05:35,541 --> 02:05:37,168
Gwen?

1718
02:05:38,311 --> 02:05:40,404
Where the hell's Frank?

1719
02:05:41,481 --> 02:05:43,278
Frank got shot.

1720
02:05:46,119 --> 02:05:48,520
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1721
02:05:56,897 --> 02:05:58,524
I got him!

1722
02:05:58,699 --> 02:06:01,133
I got Costello here!

1723
02:06:05,272 --> 02:06:07,764
Hey, good job, sarge.

1724
02:06:08,543 --> 02:06:10,101
No, it's...

1725
02:06:11,513 --> 02:06:13,105
For you.

1726
02:06:14,182 --> 02:06:17,242
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1727
02:06:20,755 --> 02:06:23,986
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1728
02:06:24,192 --> 02:06:26,627
How'd you get him without the files?

1729
02:06:26,796 --> 02:06:29,594
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1730
02:06:30,566 --> 02:06:31,931
You know that guy?

1731
02:06:32,101 --> 02:06:34,968
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1732
02:06:42,412 --> 02:06:44,073
Good to see you, trooper.

1733
02:06:44,247 --> 02:06:46,909
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1734
02:06:47,084 --> 02:06:48,642
- Yeah.
- So.

1735
02:06:50,187 --> 02:06:51,950
Now, how long were you undercover?

1736
02:06:52,122 --> 02:06:54,022
Long time.

1737
02:06:54,191 --> 02:06:56,022
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1738
02:06:56,426 --> 02:07:01,364
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1739
02:07:04,202 --> 02:07:07,535
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1740
02:07:07,705 --> 02:07:09,400
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1741
02:07:10,341 --> 02:07:12,707
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1742
02:07:14,746 --> 02:07:16,543
It's the highest honor we got.

1743
02:07:16,714 --> 02:07:19,513
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1744
02:07:19,685 --> 02:07:21,676
- That's all.
- All right.

1745
02:07:21,854 --> 02:07:24,755
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1746
02:07:24,923 --> 02:07:28,518
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1747
02:07:28,794 --> 02:07:31,763
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1748
02:07:31,930 --> 02:07:35,889
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1749
02:07:38,538 --> 02:07:40,836
How's that working for you?

1750
02:07:41,007 --> 02:07:42,736
Is it helpful?

1751
02:07:43,476 --> 02:07:46,240
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1752
02:07:48,848 --> 02:07:52,079
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1753
02:07:52,519 --> 02:07:55,216
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1754
02:07:55,389 --> 02:07:58,552
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1755
02:07:58,726 --> 02:08:02,560
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1756
02:08:02,730 --> 02:08:05,324
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1757
02:08:05,499 --> 02:08:08,059
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1758
02:08:08,235 --> 02:08:10,396
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1759
02:08:10,571 --> 02:08:12,972
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1760
02:08:13,141 --> 02:08:14,540
Fair enough.

1761
02:08:15,143 --> 02:08:19,603
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1762
02:08:21,783 --> 02:08:22,807
It's my name.

1763
02:08:23,618 --> 02:08:25,984
William Costigan Jr.

1764
02:08:26,154 --> 02:08:29,419
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1765
02:08:29,991 --> 02:08:31,926
It's your name.

1766
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:35,429
All right.

1767
02:08:35,598 --> 02:08:38,294
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1768
02:08:38,468 --> 02:08:40,698
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1769
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:43,134
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1770
02:08:43,306 --> 02:08:47,072
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1771
02:10:20,409 --> 02:10:24,243
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1772
02:10:55,211 --> 02:10:56,975
I know.

1773
02:10:58,515 --> 02:11:01,006
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1774
02:11:01,285 --> 02:11:02,877
I'm not.

1775
02:11:05,089 --> 02:11:08,354
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1776
02:11:08,525 --> 02:11:10,959
Something I need you to keep.

1777
02:11:11,128 --> 02:11:12,720
For me.

1778
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,592
Okay?

1779
02:11:20,205 --> 02:11:24,505
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1780
02:11:24,676 --> 02:11:28,635
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1781
02:11:28,813 --> 02:11:31,373
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1782
02:11:32,985 --> 02:11:34,577
Please.

1783
02:11:38,124 --> 02:11:40,524
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1784
02:11:40,693 --> 02:11:43,389
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1785
02:11:43,562 --> 02:11:46,827
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1786
02:11:48,267 --> 02:11:50,429
There's no one else.

1787
02:11:51,204 --> 02:11:53,934
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1788
02:11:54,541 --> 02:11:56,509
You know, I have...

1789
02:11:56,677 --> 02:11:59,111
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1790
02:11:59,279 --> 02:12:01,474
...think about it real hard, all right?

1791
02:12:01,648 --> 02:12:05,175
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1792
02:12:34,950 --> 02:12:36,884
I was dreaming I was dead.

1793
02:12:38,253 --> 02:12:42,451
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1794
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:46,624
- What's this?
- Open it.

1795
02:12:55,472 --> 02:12:58,134
- Really?
- Yeah.

1796
02:12:59,175 --> 02:13:00,642
Really?

1797
02:13:01,311 --> 02:13:02,836
Yeah.

1798
02:13:03,013 --> 02:13:06,574
And they say
that this little speck...

1799
02:13:06,751 --> 02:13:08,946
...is a penis.

1800
02:13:12,223 --> 02:13:14,088
It's a boy.

1801
02:13:14,258 --> 02:13:17,056
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1802
02:13:18,562 --> 02:13:20,554
Can you still?

1803
02:14:11,118 --> 02:14:13,109
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1804
02:14:13,287 --> 02:14:17,486
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1805
02:14:17,659 --> 02:14:21,322
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1806
02:14:21,496 --> 02:14:24,329
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1807
02:14:24,499 --> 02:14:29,801
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1808
02:14:29,971 --> 02:14:33,169
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1809
02:14:33,342 --> 02:14:35,708
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1810
02:14:35,878 --> 02:14:39,279
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1811
02:14:39,448 --> 02:14:43,316
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1812
02:14:46,989 --> 02:14:48,547
What?

1813
02:14:52,162 --> 02:14:53,652
What?

1814
02:14:55,966 --> 02:14:58,264
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1815
02:14:58,435 --> 02:15:02,394
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1816
02:15:02,572 --> 02:15:03,903
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1817
02:15:04,074 --> 02:15:07,669
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1818
02:15:07,844 --> 02:15:12,407
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1819
02:15:12,583 --> 02:15:15,518
Hey, I can explain that!

1820
02:15:20,691 --> 02:15:22,716
Costello recorded everything.

1821
02:15:22,894 --> 02:15:27,457
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1822
02:15:27,633 --> 02:15:29,123
His lawyer came to me.

1823
02:15:29,301 --> 02:15:31,064
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1824
02:15:31,236 --> 02:15:33,227
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1825
02:15:33,906 --> 02:15:37,103
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1826
02:15:37,609 --> 02:15:40,203
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1827
02:15:40,379 --> 02:15:42,404
...you two-faced faggot.

1828
02:15:42,714 --> 02:15:46,549
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1829
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:48,653
You keep your cell on.

1830
02:16:00,767 --> 02:16:02,531
Open the door.

1831
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:10,533
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1832
02:16:11,712 --> 02:16:13,873
This is my job.

1833
02:16:39,141 --> 02:16:41,132
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1834
02:16:41,310 --> 02:16:42,834
Put the fucking gun down!

1835
02:16:43,012 --> 02:16:46,243
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1836
02:16:46,415 --> 02:16:47,973
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1837
02:16:48,150 --> 02:16:50,175
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1838
02:16:50,353 --> 02:16:53,948
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1839
02:16:54,123 --> 02:16:57,093
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1840
02:16:57,260 --> 02:17:00,752
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1841
02:17:00,931 --> 02:17:02,922
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1842
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:04,965
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1843
02:17:05,135 --> 02:17:07,535
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1844
02:17:07,704 --> 02:17:10,537
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1845
02:17:10,707 --> 02:17:12,607
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1846
02:17:12,776 --> 02:17:16,042
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1847
02:17:16,214 --> 02:17:19,342
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1848
02:17:19,517 --> 02:17:22,179
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1849
02:17:22,353 --> 02:17:24,821
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1850
02:17:24,989 --> 02:17:27,685
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1851
02:17:27,859 --> 02:17:32,319
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1852
02:17:32,497 --> 02:17:35,262
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1853
02:17:38,003 --> 02:17:40,233
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1854
02:17:40,406 --> 02:17:42,101
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1855
02:17:42,541 --> 02:17:44,441
Get up.

1856
02:17:45,611 --> 02:17:48,637
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1857
02:17:48,814 --> 02:17:51,340
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1858
02:17:51,518 --> 02:17:54,885
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1859
02:17:55,055 --> 02:17:58,024
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1860
02:17:58,191 --> 02:18:00,318
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1861
02:18:00,493 --> 02:18:02,723
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1862
02:18:02,896 --> 02:18:06,593
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1863
02:18:06,766 --> 02:18:11,431
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1864
02:18:13,841 --> 02:18:15,775
Maybe you do.

1865
02:18:15,943 --> 02:18:18,070
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1866
02:18:18,245 --> 02:18:21,214
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1867
02:18:21,382 --> 02:18:24,351
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1868
02:18:24,518 --> 02:18:26,611
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1869
02:18:26,787 --> 02:18:28,983
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1870
02:18:32,294 --> 02:18:34,125
You know who I am.

1871
02:18:59,255 --> 02:19:01,120
Shut up.

1872
02:19:02,158 --> 02:19:05,185
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1873
02:19:05,362 --> 02:19:06,556
...you fucking cocksucker.

1874
02:19:06,730 --> 02:19:09,255
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1875
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:22,709
Just fucking kill me.

1876
02:19:24,315 --> 02:19:26,476
Just fucking kill me.

1877
02:19:28,753 --> 02:19:30,812
I am killing you.

1878
02:20:07,027 --> 02:20:09,757
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1879
02:20:09,996 --> 02:20:12,294
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1880
02:20:12,465 --> 02:20:14,160
It's you and me now, you understand?

1881
02:20:14,334 --> 02:20:17,202
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1882
02:20:30,818 --> 02:20:32,410
Give me that.

1883
02:20:47,836 --> 02:20:51,203
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1884
02:20:59,415 --> 02:21:01,610
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1885
02:21:01,784 --> 02:21:06,312
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1886
02:21:06,489 --> 02:21:08,650
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1887
02:21:08,825 --> 02:21:11,260
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1888
02:21:11,428 --> 02:21:13,623
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1889
02:21:13,797 --> 02:21:16,960
...and discovered that they had expired.

1890
02:21:20,137 --> 02:21:22,401
I just wanna go on record.

1891
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:27,099
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1892
02:21:38,089 --> 02:21:40,421
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1893
02:21:40,592 --> 02:21:43,493
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1894
02:21:43,662 --> 02:21:46,461
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1895
02:21:46,632 --> 02:21:48,964
May his soul and the souls...

1896
02:21:49,135 --> 02:21:53,970
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1897
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:55,732
Amen.

1898
02:22:25,173 --> 02:22:27,403
Detail. Half left. Face.

1899
02:22:28,776 --> 02:22:30,767
Prepare to fire.

1900
02:22:31,012 --> 02:22:32,639
Fire.

1901
02:22:32,814 --> 02:22:35,305
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1902
02:22:36,217 --> 02:22:39,243
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1903
02:22:39,687 --> 02:22:42,987
Detail. Half right. Face.

1904
02:22:56,405 --> 02:22:58,772
I'll catch up with you guys.

1905
02:23:06,049 --> 02:23:07,880
What about the baby?

1906
02:23:25,603 --> 02:23:27,230
Hi, pup.

1907
02:23:58,771 --> 02:24:00,398
Okay.

1908
02:31:14,964 --> 02:31:16,955
