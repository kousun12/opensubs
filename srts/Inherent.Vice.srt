2
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,145
She came along the alley and up the back
stairs the way she always used to.

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,860
Doc hadn't seen her in over a year.

4
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,020
Nobody had.

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,700
Back then it was always sandals...

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,260
bottom half of a flower-print bikini...

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,020
and a faded
Country Joe and the Fish T-shirt.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,020
Tonight, she was all in flatland gear...

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,860
hair a lot shorter than he remembered...

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,462
looking just like she swore
she would never look.

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,949
That you, Shasta?

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,951
Thinks he's hallucinating.

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,467
No, just a new package, I guess.

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,109
I need your help, Doc.

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,020
You know I have an office now?
It's like a day job and everything.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,420
I looked in the phone book
and almost went over there.

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,228
Then I thought better for everyone
if this looks like a secret rendezvous.

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,591
Is somebody keeping a close eye?

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,382
Just spent an hour on surface streets
trying to make it look good.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,071
You want a beer?

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,820
How about a beer? You want a beer?

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,226
Yeah.

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,862
There's this guy.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,908
Gentleman of the straight-world
persuasion?

25
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,870
Okay, Doc.

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,548
He's married.

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,948
Some... money situation?

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,140
And the wife... she knows about you?

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,580
She's seeing somebody too.

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,740
But it's not just the usual.

31
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,740
I think they're working
on some creepy, little scheme.

32
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,100
To make off with the hubby's fortune?

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,271
Yeah, I think I've heard
of that happening once or twice.

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,706
And you want me to do... what exactly?

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,548
Is they want me in on it.

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,100
They think I'm the one who can reach him
when he's vulnerable.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,382
Or as much as he ever gets.

38
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,980
Bare-ass and asleep.

39
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,182
I knew you'd understand.

40
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,630
Are you still trying to figure out
if it's right or wrong?

41
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,584
Worse than that.

42
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,508
How much loyalty I owe him.

43
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,630
Groovy.

44
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,900
All right...

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,980
emotions aside, let's look at the rent.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,340
How much of... your rent's
he been picking up?

47
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,940
- All of it.
- Pretty... hefty?

48
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,580
For Hancock Park?

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,460
You're giving him IOUs
for everything, of course.

50
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,740
You fucker. If I had known
you were still this bitter...

51
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,944
Me? I'm trying to be
professional, is all.

52
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,340
All right.

53
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,421
How much have the... wifey
and boyfriend offered to cut you in for?

54
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,780
It isn't what you're thinking.

55
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,187
Don't worry. Thinking comes later.

56
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,540
What else?

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,144
I'm not sure.

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,149
It sounds like they wanna commit him
to a loony bin.

59
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,308
Back when they were together...

60
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,260
she could go weeks without anything
more complicated than a pout.

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,820
Now she was laying some heavy
combination of face ingredients...

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,910
on Doc that he couldn't read at all.

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,460
Argh. Fuck.

64
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,100
Come to think of it, there'd never
been this much sorrow in her voice.

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,500
Heard you're seeing someone downtown?

66
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,986
Penny?

67
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,591
Some kind of junior DA?

68
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,030
Yeah, you think... somebody down there
could stop this before it happens?

69
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,827
Not too many places
I could go with this, Doc.

70
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,940
I'll talk to Penny.

71
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,029
See what we can see.

72
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,865
Your happy couple, they have names?

73
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,869
It's Mickey Wolfmann.

74
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,980
Who's always in the paper?
The real-estate big shot?

75
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,420
Yeah.

76
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,427
Can't tell anyone about this, Doc.

77
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,542
Deaf and dumb, part of my job.

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,184
How do I reach you?

79
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,310
You don't.

80
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,380
I moved out of my old place.
Staying where I can anymore.

81
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,150
Don't ask.

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,790
There's room here.

83
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,583
Walk me down to my car?

84
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,703
Someone might be watching.

85
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,580
- You never did let me down, Doc.
- Don't worry. I'll...

86
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,067
No, I mean, really. Ever.

87
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,100
Sure I did.

88
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,951
No. You were always true.

89
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,540
You know, you don't have to go.

90
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,390
Watch your toes.

91
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,944
Vroom.

92
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,740
Doc ran through all the things
he hadn't asked Shasta.

93
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,780
Like how much she'd come to depend on...

94
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,580
Wolfmann's guaranteed level
of ease and power.

95
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,980
And least askable of all:

96
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,662
How passionately did she really feel
about old Mickey?

97
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,060
- Hey, what's up, Doc?
- Hey, Denis.

98
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,420
What's up, man?
What's going on? Doing all right?

99
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,700
"I love him. What else?"

100
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,780
With the unspoken footnote...

101
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,820
that the word these days
was being way too overused.

102
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,545
What you looking at?

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,500
You hungry?

104
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,780
Like Godzilla says to Mothra, man:

105
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,500
"Let's go eat someplace."

106
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,460
So when Doc and Denis
came in that night...

107
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,869
it wasn't just the usual
hungry doper thing.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
It was something else.

109
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,580
And with Neptune moving
at last out of the Scorpio death-trip...

110
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,500
and rising into the Sagittarian light
of the higher mind...

111
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,540
it was bound to be
something love-related.

112
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,140
And I thought I knew what it was.

113
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,751
So...?

114
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,300
She stuck her head in for a minute.

115
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,500
You feeling broken up?

116
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,620
Kind of weird
seeing her again, you know?

117
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,540
Yeah, I figured next time I saw her,
it'd be on the tube.

118
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,583
Not in person.

119
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,860
Well, you'd better do
something about this.

120
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,060
Yeah, again?

121
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,580
Can't tell you enough:
Change your hair, change your life.

122
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,140
Well, what do you recommend?

123
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,900
It's up to you.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,421
Follow your intuition.

125
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,540
Hello?

126
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,230
Hey, Aunt Reet?

127
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,260
- Hello?
- Yes, honey. Make it quick.

128
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,820
I got a live one tonight,
and I totally fucked up my face.

129
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,940
Aw. Oh, okay. Mickey Wolfmann,
what can you tell me?

130
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,580
Powerhouse in L.A. real estate.

131
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,100
From the desert to the sea.

132
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,740
Technically Jewish,
but wants to be a Nazi.

133
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,300
What's he to you?

134
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,780
Possible case.

135
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,189
Let's say I wanted to hang out
and rap with this Wolfmann.

136
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,100
Say it's a really bad idea.

137
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,580
He goes around with a dozen bikers,
mostly Aryan Brotherhood alumni.

138
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

139
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,020
I flunked Social Studies...

140
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,460
but... Jews and Aryan Brotherhood...

141
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,380
isn't there something about hatred?

142
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,020
No. Mickey's eccentric.
More and more lately.

143
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,860
I'd say, stoned out of his fucking mind
since he discovered drugs.

144
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,180
No offense to you, Doc.

145
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,180
So where would I... find him?
Like accidentally?

146
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,260
Try the Channel View Estates,
his latest insult to the environment.

147
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,540
The one that Bigfoot Bjornsen
does the commercials for?

148
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,540
That's the one.

149
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,140
Maybe your old cop buddy's the one
who should be taking care of your case.

150
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,780
Yeah, well, I did think
about going to Bigfoot with this...

151
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,860
but just as I reached for the phone,
history and all, I thought:

152
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,480
Well, maybe you're better off
with the Nazis.

153
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,180
All right, all right.

154
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,340
I got major liquid-liner issues.
I gotta get off now, Larry.

155
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,701
All right.

156
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,180
Morning, Sam.

157
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,980
Hey, man.

158
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,900
I don't want you paying rent.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,940
Rent's a hassle.
I wanna see you in your own pad...

160
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,340
Howdy, Bigfoot.

161
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,140
...at Channel View Estates...

162
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,740
Artesia's newest and grooviest
residential housing development.

163
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,860
No buzzkill credit checks.

164
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,340
No rip-off minimum down payments.
That's not your bag.

165
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,980
But check this out:

166
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,460
Fully-equipped kitchen with automatic
self-cleaning oven and breakfast nook.

167
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,980
Out of sight.

168
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,460
Attached one-car
and available two-car garage.

169
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,020
And best of all...

170
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,620
a view of the Dominguez
Flood Control Channel...

171
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,460
that can only be described in two words:

172
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,150
Right on.

173
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,180
So, what's all this now?

174
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,183
What's up, Doc?

175
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,230
What...?

176
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,540
"Michael Wolfmann, one of Los Angeles's
most prominent real estate developers...

177
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,700
announced at a press conference...

178
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,100
he's proceeding with construction
of several housing developments...

179
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,580
the most immediate
to be Channel View Estates.

180
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,260
- Hey, Doc.
- Howdy.

181
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,900
Cop came around last night
looking for you again.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,420
- Bigfoot?
- Yeah. That's the one.

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,740
I wonder why he didn't kick in my door
like usual.

184
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,140
He might've been thinking about it, but said
something like, "Tomorrow's another day."

185
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,069
Which would be today, right?

186
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,021
Not if I can help it.

187
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,020
All right, "Wolfmann,
known for his outlandish advertising...

188
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,140
and aggressive style, has been...

189
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,060
involved in the Southern
California real estate market..."

190
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,150
for the past 23 fucking years, you know.

191
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,420
- Morning, Doc.
- Hey. Morning, Petunia.

192
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,460
- I love your Afro.
- Oh, yeah? Thank you.

193
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,470
Oh, Doc. You have someone
waiting in your office.

194
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,985
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

195
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,745
Hey, man. Sorry to... keep you waiting.

196
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,620
- Dr. Sportello?
- That's right. What it is, my brother.

197
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,780
Peace. I'm Tariq Khalil.

198
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,020
Cool.

199
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,631
Sit down.

200
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,580
What's up, man?
How can I help you today?

201
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,420
There's this white boy I was
in the joint with. Aryan Brotherhood.

202
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,620
We did some business, and...
now we're both out and he still owes me.

203
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,180
I can't tell you the details,
but it's a whole lot of money.

204
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,500
How about his name?

205
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,500
Glen Charlock.

206
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,500
And... you know where he's staying now?

207
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,420
I know where he works.

208
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,385
He's a bodyguard
for this builder named Wolfmann.

209
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,060
If you don't mind my asking, Mr. Khalil,
how'd you hear about me?

210
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,100
Sledge. Sledge Poteet.

211
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,340
Wow.

212
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,100
Blast from the past. Far out.

213
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,660
Yeah.

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,300
He said you helped him out
of a situation back in '67.

215
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,420
First time I got shot at.

216
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,620
If you don't mind an obvious question...

217
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,660
you... know where
this Glen Charlock works.

218
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,340
Why not... just go over there
and look him up directly?

219
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,380
Well, because Wolfmann likes to surround
himself with the Aryan Brotherhood.

220
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,140
Day and night.

221
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,260
And, see, outside of Glen,
I ain't never liked the company of Nazis.

222
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,020
So... send some white guy
to get his head hammered?

223
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,260
More or less.

224
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,420
Now when you were inside,
were you in a gang?

225
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,748
The Black Guerrilla Family.

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,700
And you say you did business with who now?
The Aryan Brotherhood?

227
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,180
Listen...

228
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,220
we found we share some of the similar
opinions about the U.S. government.

229
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,660
That's all.

230
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,669
I can dig.

231
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,860
There's something else?

232
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,301
Matter of fact, there is.

233
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,660
My old street gang. The Artesia Crips.

234
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,580
See, when I came home from Chino...

235
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,380
I looked for them
and found it ain't just them gone...

236
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,980
but the whole damn turf itself.

237
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,300
What do you mean "gone"?

238
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,100
Man, I'm talking not there.

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,700
Ground up into little pieces.
Seagulls picking all over it.

240
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,700
Man, I thought I was tripping.

241
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,029
Got in my car, I drove around,
came back, still gone.

242
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,060
Nothing. Nobody. Just a ghost town.

243
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,300
With a big sign that said,
Coming to this site soon.

244
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,940
With a big-ass ugly picture
of some houses.

245
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,620
- And guess who the builder is?
- Let me guess...

246
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,788
Wolfmann again.

247
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,140
Okay. Can you show me
up here on the map?

248
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,140
Long, sad history of L.A. land use.

249
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,420
Mexican families bounced out
of Chavez Ravine...

250
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,700
to build Dodger Stadium.

251
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,740
American Indians swept out
of Bunker Hill for the Music Center.

252
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,980
And now Tariq's neighborhood...

253
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,787
bulldozed aside
for Channel View Estates.

254
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,470
Hello?

255
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,180
Hi. I'm Jade.

256
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,020
Welcome to Chick Planet Massage.

257
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,140
Take note of today's Pussy Eater's Special,
which is good all day till closing time.

258
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,260
- How much is it?
- Fourteen ninety-five.

259
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,980
Well, not that 14.95 ain't
a totally groovy price...

260
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,100
but I'm trying to locate this guy
who works for Mr. Wolfmann.

261
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,940
Oh, does he eat pussy?

262
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,460
Fella named Glen Charlock?

263
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,020
Oh, sure, Glen. He comes in here.
He eats pussy.

264
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,660
Well, Glen and I were in Chino around
the same time. You seen him today?

265
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,300
Are you a cop?

266
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,786
Nope.

267
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,660
The reason I ask is if you were a cop...

268
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,300
you'd be entitled to a free preview
of our special.

269
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,309
Well, how about a licensed Pl?

270
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,749
Hey, Bambi!

271
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,628
Oh, my...

272
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,980
Oh, do...?

273
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,706
Where do we...?

274
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,862
Not you, Bong Brain.

275
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,540
See, I thought here, where it says
Pussy Eater's Special...

276
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,868
is what that means is...

277
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,225
That's groovy.

278
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,265
Congratulations, hippie scum.

279
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,860
And welcome to a world of inconvenience.

280
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,220
Well, morning, Sam.

281
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,540
Like a bad luck planet
in today's horoscope...

282
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,740
here's the old hippie-hating
mad dog himself in the flesh:

283
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,900
Lieutenant Detective
Christian F. Bigfoot Bjornsen.

284
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,860
SAG member, John Wayne walk,
flattop of Flintstone proportions...

285
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,340
and that little evil-shit twinkle in his eye
that says "civil rights violations."

286
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,190
What's up, Doc?

287
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,782
How about your ex-girlfriend?

288
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,740
Shasta...

289
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,740
Fay...

290
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,146
Hepworth.

291
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,580
Shasta Fay Hepworth.

292
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,468
She is a known intimate
of Glen's employer, Mickey Wolfmann.

293
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,749
But do you think
that Glen and Shasta were...

294
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,831
F-U-C-K-I-N-G-ing?

295
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,666
Fucking-ing?

296
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,948
Is that why you killed him?

297
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,504
- Bigfoot...
- How does it make you feel?

298
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,580
Here you are still carrying the torch...

299
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,620
and there she is in the company
of all those Nazi lowlifes?

300
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,420
Keep doing that, Bigfoot.
You're giving me a hard-on.

301
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,670
Tough little wop monkey,
as my friend Fatso Judson always says.

302
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,100
So while suspect, that's you...

303
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,941
is having alleged midday nap
so necessary to the hippie lifestyle...

304
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,220
some sort of incident occurs
in the vicinity of Channel View Estates.

305
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,460
Firearms are discharged. When the dust
settles, we find one Glen Charlock deceased.

306
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,420
But more compellingly for L.A.P.D. is the man
Charlock was supposed to be guarding.

307
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,420
Michael Z. Wolfmann has vanished...

308
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,500
giving local law enforcement
less than 24 hours...

309
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,340
before the Feds call it a kidnapping
and come in to fuck everything up.

310
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,940
So perhaps, Sportello,
you can help forestall this...

311
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,871
by providing the names
of the other members of your cult.

312
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,460
Cult?

313
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,100
No one would be stupid enough
to attempt this alone...

314
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,065
which suggests some kind
of Mansonoid conspiracy. Agree?

315
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,860
No.

316
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,340
Look, I've been referred to...

317
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,700
more than one time by the L.A. Times...

318
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,780
as a Renaissance detective. Okay?

319
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,100
Which means I am many things.

320
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,460
One thing I am not is stupid...

321
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,340
so purely out of noblesse oblige, I extend
this assumption to cover you as well.

322
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,540
What the fuck?

323
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,180
Hey, Saunch.

324
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,820
What's up, Doc?

325
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,700
You know you have no case here.

326
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,980
So if you're gonna
charge him, you better.

327
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,700
Otherwise, you have to let him go.

328
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,746
Remember who this is you're talking to.
That's Bigfoot Bjornsen. Renaissance cop.

329
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,270
I know who he is.

330
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,540
So, what's the beef here, exactly?

331
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,900
It doesn't have much to do with your specialty,
which I understand is marine law?

332
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,262
We got plenty of crime on the high seas.

333
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,900
Okay, well, so far, we have murder.
And kidnapping.

334
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,060
We can work in pirates
if it would make you more comfortable.

335
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,700
Either way, it's high-profile.

336
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,260
Yeah, but...

337
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,660
given your history of harassment with
my client, this'll never make it to trial.

338
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,180
No, I think we could
take this to trial...

339
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,620
but with our luck, you know,
the jury pool will be 99 percent...

340
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,820
hippie.

341
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,420
Unless you change the venue
to, like, Orange County.

342
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,380
Not as many hippies there, you know?

343
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,940
Saunch, who you working for?

344
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,031
Clients pay me for work, Doc.
Clients pay me for work, Doc.

345
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,387
So?

346
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,020
I've decided I'm gonna
kick Mr. Sportello.

347
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,020
You're gonna kick him?
Well, that's assault.

348
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,980
I think it's police slang, Saunch.
It means "cut me loose."

349
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,420
I'll release the suspect
at the impound garage.

350
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,906
Promise?

351
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,990
I promise.

352
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,540
Apparently, a party of civilians
on some training exercise...

353
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,260
in anti-guerrilla warfare.

354
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,500
They assumed
that this construction site...

355
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,580
not yet open for occupancy...

356
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,340
was deserted enough
to provide a realistic setting...

357
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,989
for what we must assume
was only a harmless patriotic scenario.

358
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,100
Tragically, however, live ammunition somehow
found its way into these war games...

359
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,660
and tonight, one ex-prison inmate lies slain
while prominent construction mogul...

360
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,140
Michael Wolfmann has vanished.

361
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,860
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

362
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,180
Hey.

363
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,667
Listen, we...

364
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,460
We sent a police academy hotshot
over to the last known address...

365
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,860
of Shasta Fay Hepworth.

366
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,540
Oh, fuck. No, not this.

367
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,141
Yeah, they got there, and it was...

368
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,580
- They looked in the window and...
- What?

369
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,986
What?

370
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,789
They tried to open the door,
and she's just...

371
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,146
They went in and, you know.

372
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,469
You know, she's gone.

373
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,147
Sportello, she's gone.

374
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,980
She's out there, man.

375
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,620
- Out there?
- Yeah.

376
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,060
What does that mean?

377
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,020
She's disappeared, just like Mickey.
Maybe you'd think there was a connection.

378
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,747
- She's disappeared?
- Yeah, she's gone, man. Baby.

379
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,940
She's gone. She disappeared. What...?

380
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,900
She went all groovy on us.

381
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,620
You know, Bigfoot, man.

382
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,420
Can we just try
to be fucking professional?

383
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,100
I mean, just pretend to be professional.

384
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,740
Shasta Fay Hepworth. She's gone.

385
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,271
Fuck you.

386
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,260
Doc could never figure out
what Shasta might've seen in him...

387
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,820
besides being just about the only doper
she knew who didn't use heroin...

388
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,060
freeing up a lot of time
for both of them.

389
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,820
And it wasn't any clearer
about what had driven them apart either.

390
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,420
They each gradually located
a different karmic thermal...

391
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,750
watching the other glide away
into different fates.

392
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,540
Does it ever end?

393
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,260
Of course it does.

394
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,905
If did.

395
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,746
Hello?

396
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,820
Hello?

397
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,183
Mr. Sportello?

398
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,060
I got your number from the head shop.

399
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,620
Down in Gordita Beach.

400
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,140
I'm calling about my husband.
He was a...

401
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,580
close friend of a friend of yours.

402
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,669
Shasta Fay Hepworth.

403
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,660
And... your name is...?

404
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,580
Hope Harlingen.

405
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,820
And your husband is...?

406
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,670
Dead.

407
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,180
I'm sorry to hear that.

408
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,340
- Do you want a cookie?
- I'm all right.

409
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,820
So you never heard of him or his music?

410
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,500
Inside the surf-sax category
he was this towering figure...

411
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,620
because he improvised once in a while.

412
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,740
Instead of repeating the second
and third chorus note for note.

413
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,711
Coy and I should've met cute,
but we actually met squalid.

414
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,020
Down at Oscar's in San Ysidro.

415
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,900
Oh, boy.

416
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,260
I had just run into this bathroom stall
without checking first...

417
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,700
and I already had my finger
down my throat to vomit up...

418
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,744
this big balloon of dope
I had just scored...

419
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,585
and there Coy sat, gringo digestion,
about to take this giant shit.

420
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,060
And we both let go at the same time...

421
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,380
and there's just vomit
and shit all over the place...

422
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,105
and with my head in his lap.

423
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,501
And to complicate things,
he had this hard-on.

424
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,060
Sure.

425
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,380
One thing leads to another and...

426
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,550
We pretty much started shooting up
together on a regular basis.

427
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,106
Then along comes little Amethyst.

428
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,946
I don't know if you have
the stomach for it, but...

429
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,304
This is...

430
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,580
what we had her looking like.

431
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,860
Everybody helpfully pointed out how...

432
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,791
the heroin was actually coming
through my breast milk...

433
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,748
but who could afford
formula, you know?

434
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,540
It's a long way from where we are now.

435
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,820
Yeah, no, seems like
you're doing real good.

436
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,460
I'm a drug counselor.

437
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,780
- Sorry?
- A drug counselor.

438
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,662
Trying to talk kids
into sensible drug use.

439
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,140
What do you think of my chompers?

440
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,785
You like them?

441
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,630
No... I... Yes. Yeah.
No, I hadn't noticed.

442
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,100
Heroin sucks the calcium out
of your body like a vampire.

443
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,543
If you use it for any length of time,
your teeth just go all to hell.

444
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,105
And that's the good part.

445
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,505
So listen, this thing that happened
to your husband, how can I help you?

446
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,668
Mr. Sportello,
I don't think Coy is really dead.

447
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,700
Well, did you ID his body?

448
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,186
No.

449
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,420
Whoever it was that called...

450
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,380
just said that one
of his band members did that.

451
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,780
What do you mean "whoever called"?
The police?

452
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,870
I mean, it's...
supposed to be next of kin.

453
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,264
And then this deposit shows up.
Close to his disappearance.

454
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,540
Interesting sum.

455
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,420
Why would this big deposit
just suddenly appear in my account?

456
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,020
I went to the bank.
I talked to the bank manager.

457
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,540
He kept saying:
"You just lost your deposit slip."

458
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,020
"You just lost your deposit slip."

459
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,985
And I don't lose deposit slips this big.

460
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,460
Do you have a picture of Coy
I could borrow?

461
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,150
That, I do have.

462
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,380
These were perilous times,
astrologically speaking, for dopers...

463
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,740
especially those of high school age.

464
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,660
Who'd been born, most of them,
under a 90-degree aspect...

465
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,540
the unluckiest angle possible...

466
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,500
between Neptune, the doper's planet...

467
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,421
and Uranus,
the planet of rude surprises.

468
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,100
Doc had known it to happen...

469
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,740
that those left behind would refuse
to believe that people they loved...

470
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,900
or even took the same classes with,
were really dead.

471
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,231
They came up with all kinds of alternate
stories so it wouldn't have to be true.

472
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,350
- Yeah.
- How did Coy and Shasta know each other?

473
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,270
She picked us up hitchhiking once.

474
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,701
I think Coy and her stayed in touch somehow.
I don't really know for sure.

475
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,546
All right, well... I'll call you
when I know something.

476
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,151
Thank you.

477
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,660
See you.

478
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,820
Shasta had mentioned a possible
laughing academy angle...

479
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,300
to Mickey Wolfmann's matrimonial drama.

480
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,940
And Doc thought
it might be interesting to see...

481
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,740
how society-page superstar
Mrs. Sloane Wolfmann would react...

482
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,980
when somebody brought up the topic.

483
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,300
If Mickey was currently being held
against his will in some private nuthouse...

484
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,860
then Doc's immediate chore would
be to try and find out which one.

485
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,380
Do you like the lighting?

486
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,384
Jimmy Wong Howe did it for us.
Years ago.

487
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,220
Luz!

488
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,629
The midday refrescos now,
if you wouldn't mind.

489
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,740
Shall we sit?

490
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,140
Now, your husband was planning
to endow a new wing for our facility.

491
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,180
He actually tendered us
a sum in advance.

492
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,820
Somehow, it didn't seem right
to keep the money...

493
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,100
while little was known
of his whereabouts.

494
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,180
So we'd like to refund you the sum.

495
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,260
And if, and as we all pray...

496
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,540
when Mr. Wolfmann is heard from again,
why then, perhaps...

497
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,500
the process can resume again.

498
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,660
We did recently endow another facility.

499
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,271
In Ojai.

500
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,660
- In Ojai?
- The Chryskylodon Institute.

501
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,180
Kriskleddone?

502
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,900
It's an ancient Indian word
that means "serenity."

503
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,380
Of course.

504
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,500
Are you somehow a subsidiary?

505
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,351
Perhaps one of our Sister Sanatoria?

506
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,943
Mr. Riggs Warbling.

507
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,700
My spiritual coach.

508
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,940
- How do you do?
- Pleasurable.

509
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,380
If you tell us where to send the refund
and what form you'd like it in...

510
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,820
Small bills! With nonconsecutive
serial numbers.

511
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,020
Riggs! Enough.

512
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,220
He's always making these terrible jokes.
I'm so sorry.

513
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,140
Perhaps if a company officer...

514
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,220
simply endorsed Michael's check
back to one of his accounts.

515
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,780
Of course. Let us know the account number
and it's as good as in the mail.

516
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,870
- Let me find you a deposit form.
- Wonderful.

517
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,300
So this is Riggs.

518
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,540
The spiritual adviser.

519
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,940
And there's Sloane.

520
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,781
Maybe not so much English rose
as English daffodil.

521
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,780
And this is L.A.P.D., busy as ever.

522
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,740
Protecting and serving.

523
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,740
Getting in some last-minute free catering
before the Feds show up.

524
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,540
And there's Luz,
the sexy Chicana housekeeper.

525
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,425
Or pretending to be?

526
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,780
Some kidnapping.

527
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,300
Doc would bet an ounce of seedless Hawaiian
and throw in a pack of Zig-Zags...

528
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,180
that Sloane and old Riggs here
were fucking regularly.

529
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,429
And that this was
the BF Shasta had mentioned.

530
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,780
Did Shasta have a room of her own here?

531
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,631
Or did they all just cozy up together?

532
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,780
Holy shit!

533
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,380
I'm ticklish, babe.

534
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,900
Oh, I like that.

535
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,900
Keep looking. I'm in there somewhere.

536
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,340
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

537
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,900
Oh, Vicky.

538
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,420
Oh, Roxy.

539
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,191
Carol, Sloane...

540
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,740
Cute, huh?

541
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,140
My tits aren't really that big,
but it's the thought that counts.

542
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,580
Now, did... all of you ladies
pose for these?

543
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,148
A guy over in North Hollywood
does custom work.

544
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,260
And what about that...
girl that's gone missing?

545
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,500
Shasta?

546
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,180
- Yeah, she's in there someplace.
- Yeah?

547
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,740
You know Mickey used to take me
in the shower to fuck?

548
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,940
Oh, yeah?

549
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,140
And I never got to do anything
on that groovy bed in there.

550
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,740
Luz!

551
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,580
Another time, perhaps?

552
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,184
Black girl.

553
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,065
Bigfoot.

554
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,820
Something had been puzzling
Doc now for a while.

555
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,582
Namely, what, exactly, the fuck,
was with Bigfoot here?

556
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,780
As much as he'd like to stay and chat...

557
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,620
he had a lunch date to keep
with part-time squeeze...

558
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,221
Deputy DA Penny Kimball.

559
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:25,060
It was only because someone else had
canceled that she was able to pencil him in.

560
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,061
And Doc didn't wanna fuck up her act,
considering they were meeting in public.

561
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,780
Hi.

562
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,620
This Wolfmann-Charlock case...

563
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,505
Apparently, one of your girlfriends
is a principal.

564
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,180
I just heard that she skipped.

565
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,980
Let me put it to you like this:

566
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,180
How close were you
with Shasta Fay Hepworth?

567
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,100
I've been asking myself
that very question.

568
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,100
It was all over years ago.

569
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,580
- Months? I don't know.
- Years?

570
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,500
If you hadn't come along,
who knows how bad it might've got?

571
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,420
- True. You were a mess when I met you.
- And how about now?

572
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,467
Old times aside, have you had any contact
with her in the last, say, week or so?

573
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,543
Well, funny you should ask.

574
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,660
She called me up a couple days ago
before Mickey Wolfmann disappeared.

575
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,780
Told me how his wife
and her boyfriend...

576
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,100
were plotting to hustle Mickey
and grab all his money.

577
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,140
So I sure hope that you guys or the cops
or whoever are looking into that.

578
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,100
With your years of experience as a Pl,
would you call that a reliable lead?

579
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,870
I've known worse.

580
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,540
Oh, I can dig.
You're just gonna ignore that?

581
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,300
Some hippie chick with boyfriend trouble,
brains mushed up with dope and sex?

582
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,100
I've never seen you so emotional.

583
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,620
The lights are out.
Never seen you during the day.

584
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,500
You didn't tell Bjornsen any of this
when he pulled you in at the crime scene.

585
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,780
That's because I promised Shasta
I'd come talk to you first, right?

586
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,220
See if anybody at the DA could help out
with this. I tried to call you.

587
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,020
- Day and night. No reply.
- You tried to call me. Really?

588
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,940
Yeah. Look, I forgot. I don't know.

589
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,740
Look, all know is the next thing...

590
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,900
Shasta's missing, Wolfmann's gone
and... Glen Charlock's dead.

591
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,220
Bjornsen seems to think
you're as good a suspect as any.

592
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,180
"Seems to"? Wait a minute.
You been talking to Bigfoot about me?

593
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,140
Doc, please.

594
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,500
Besides, maybe you did it.
Has that crossed your mind?

595
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,620
- Maybe you just forgot?
- What? Did do what?

596
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,020
Killed Glen Charlock.

597
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,580
- Kill him?
- Yeah.

598
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,861
What?

599
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,740
How would I forget something like that?

600
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,220
- Grass, and who knows what else.
- I'm only a light smoker.

601
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,100
- How many joints have you had today?
- Check the logbook.

602
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,711
Can't remember?

603
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,460
I don't see how my smoking has any link
to the Wolfmann-Charlock-Shasta case.

604
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,660
No?

605
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,180
Then how come Miss Hepworth
dismantled your relationship?

606
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,189
She had other fish to fry.

607
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,750
Would you say
you're still in love with her?

608
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,620
No.

609
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,584
Take off your glasses.

610
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,020
No.

611
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,620
I'm not... Wait. What is this?

612
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,980
Hectic week ahead for me, so unless things
heat up dramatically, I hope you understand.

613
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,864
Walk me back to work?

614
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,500
I'm Agent Flatweed.
This is Agent Borderline. FBI.

615
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,500
- I'm with...
- I have to use the bathroom.

616
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,780
It's been brought to our attention...

617
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,540
you had a visit from a black prison
militant calling himself Tariq Khalil.

618
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,300
We naturally became curious.

619
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,628
Let's talk upstairs, Larry.

620
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,900
Did I miss an episode?

621
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,262
I love you guys
every Sunday night, 8 p.m.

622
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,580
We like investigating and spending energy
on Black Nationalist Hate Groups.

623
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,020
It's the chronology, really.
Khalil visits your place of business.

624
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,300
The next day, a known prison acquaintance
of his, Glen Charlock, is slain...

625
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,060
Michael Wolfmann disappears
and you get arrested on suspicion...

626
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,300
and, somewhat mysteriously,
let go again.

627
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,220
Yeah. Well, have you talked
to Bigfoot Bjornsen about this?

628
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,500
He's real intelligent
about this kind of shit.

629
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,540
Mr. Bjornsen's antipathy
at the federal level is well known.

630
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,580
Some guys are like that.

631
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,700
So, what is it you want with me?

632
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,506
Ordinarily, we're the ones
asking the questions here.

633
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,468
Sure thing, fellas.

634
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,420
But aren't we all in the same business?

635
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,220
There's no need to be insulting.

636
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,300
Why don't you just tell us
what Mr. Khalil had to say...

637
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,264
when he visited you the other day.

638
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,420
Because he's privileged
and I'm a client is why.

639
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,591
If it has a bearing on the Wolfmann case,
then we may have to disagree.

640
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,580
Look, I really wish
I could help you guys out, but...

641
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,460
if you're so focused
on the Black Panthers...

642
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,550
then what's with your interest
in Mickey Wolfmann?

643
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,543
Is somebody playing Monopoly...
with federal housing money?

644
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,900
Are you figuring Mickey's kidnapping
is a Black Panther operation?

645
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,500
They put the snatch on Mickey,
trying to prove a political point...

646
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,182
or maybe a nice shot
at some ransom money?

647
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,700
Maybe you've thought of putting that forward
as a cover story for whatever did happen.

648
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,382
Do you realize how thoroughly
we can fuck your life up?

649
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,220
Right.

650
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,820
Can I be frank a minute?

651
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,100
- Why stop now?
- Please.

652
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,700
All right. You be Dino.
You be the other guy.

653
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,300
And tell Penny Davis, Jr.
what a lovely day we had. Thank you.

654
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,580
As a COINTELPRO informant, you could
be making up to $300 a month, Larry.

655
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,340
Just consider that.

656
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,820
U.S. dollars?

657
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,860
And we'll throw in a Book of Mormon.

658
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,107
Free.

659
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,140
Doc, a mysterious,
young oriental cutie...

660
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,822
just dropped off a package
for you at the front desk.

661
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,146
Well...

662
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,020
it's dark and lonely work,
but somebody's gotta do it, right?

663
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,020
Heard they cut you loose.
Need to see you about something.

664
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,780
I'm working weeknights
at Club Asiatique in San Pedro.

665
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,108
Love and peace, Jade.

666
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,541
P.S. Beware the Golden Fang!

667
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,020
I can't stay out here long.
This is Golden Fang territory.

668
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,460
A girl don't necessarily wanna get
into difficulties with those folks.

669
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,500
What is it? A band?

670
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,820
You wish.

671
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,660
I just wanted to say how sorry I was.
I felt shitty about what I did.

672
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,500
- Which was what again?
- I'm not a snitch.

673
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,580
The cops said they'd drop charges
if we put you in the scene...

674
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,940
which they already knew you were.

675
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,260
- I'm, like, so sorry, Larry.
- Call me Doc. It's cool, Jade.

676
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,460
- That copper?
- Bigfoot?

677
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,100
He's a warped sheet of plastic.

678
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,820
So was it Bigfoot who put me
on the Buenos Noches Express...

679
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,181
or did he subcontract it?

680
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,300
I missed all that, man. Last thing
I remember was eating Bambi's pussy...

681
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,420
and Puck Beaverton's tattoo,
like, it was pulsating.

682
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,660
Puck...? What's a Puck Beaverton?

683
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,740
He's a baldheaded asshole
with a swastika tattoo you don't wanna meet.

684
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,945
We were so freaked with the BadAss Brigade
stomping in there, we didn't stick around.

685
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,660
There's somebody who wants to talk to you.
He thinks you can help each other out.

686
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,229
He's a new face. I'm not sure of his name,
but I know he's in some trouble.

687
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,140
I would've come by your office, man...

688
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,220
but I thought
there might be unfriendly eyeballs.

689
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,700
Hi.

690
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,660
Well, is this safe enough
for you out here?

691
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,340
Let's light this and pretend
we came out to smoke.

692
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,900
- All right.
- I'm supposed to be dead.

693
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,100
There's also a rumor that you're not.

694
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,220
That don't come as such great news.
Being dead is part of my job image.

695
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,024
Like what I do.

696
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,580
You working
for these people at the club?

697
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,820
I don't know. Maybe.
It's where I pick up my paycheck.

698
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,300
Where are you staying?

699
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,340
House in Topanga Canyon.

700
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,580
Band I used to play for, The Boards.

701
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,820
But none of them know it's me.

702
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,940
How can they not know it's you?

703
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,540
Even when I was alive,
they didn't know it was me.

704
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,220
The sax player. The session guy.

705
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,380
Plus, over the years, there's been
a big turnover in personnel.

706
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,500
Like, The Boards I played with...

707
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,740
most of them have gone off
and formed other bands.

708
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,740
Only one or two of the old crew left...

709
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,580
and, luckily, they're suffering
from heavy Doper's Memory.

710
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,420
Story is you came to grief
behind some bad smack.

711
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,140
You still into that?

712
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,580
No.

713
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,466
No.

714
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,228
I'm clean these days.

715
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,180
I spent my time rehabilitating up in...

716
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,700
- You know, I...
- It's okay.

717
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,500
How can I talk about what I don't hear?

718
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,906
Yeah.

719
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,620
The thing I wanted to see you about...

720
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,020
I was wondering
if you could check on people.

721
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,180
A lady and a little girl.

722
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,460
See if they're okay,
without bringing me into it.

723
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:30,900
It's down in Torrance.
Just see if they're still living there.

724
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,380
See what's in the driveway.

725
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,100
Law enforcement in the picture,
any details you find interesting.

726
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,984
All right, I'm on it.

727
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,581
I can't pay you right now.

728
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,260
When you can.

729
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,620
Unless you believe
information is money...

730
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,940
in which case,
I could ask you something.

731
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,740
Bearing in mind that either
I don't know...

732
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,511
or it's my ass if I tell you...

733
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,580
what is it?

734
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,700
Ever heard of the Golden Fang?

735
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,660
Sure. It's a boat.

736
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,340
- A boat?
- A big schooner, somebody said.

737
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,545
Brings stuff in and out of the country,
but no one wants to talk about it.

738
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,585
Because?

739
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,065
That was it.

740
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,860
How do you know?

741
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,189
Saw it sail in when I got here tonight.

742
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,020
I don't know what I just saw.

743
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,710
Me neither.

744
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,389
Fact, I don't even wanna know.

745
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,540
- Okay.
- Coy.

746
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,620
Doc figured it might have been
easier to let Coy know...

747
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,900
that Hope and little Amethyst
were doing just fine.

748
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,820
But he had a rule against getting
involved in matrimonials...

749
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,220
which had just gone up in smoke...

750
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,740
like the Asian indica in the joint
they'd been smoking...

751
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,300
creating an extra layer of fog on top of
the one Doc was already standing inside of.

752
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,020
Meet the schooner Golden Fang,
out of Charlotte Amalie.

753
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,666
- Where is that?
- U.S. Virgin Islands.

754
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,500
- Bermuda Triangle?
- Close enough.

755
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,623
Sizable vessel.

756
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:13,620
She has a tendency to show up here
in the middle of the night...

757
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,340
no running lights...

758
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,140
no radio traffic.

759
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,300
See, the problem with this vessel
is trying to find out anything.

760
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,027
People back off, change the subject
and get real creepy.

761
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,946
The owners are listed
as a consortium in the Bahamas.

762
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,780
Her real name isn't really
the Golden Fang.

763
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,060
She was originally a fishing boat
named Preserved.

764
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,980
Then after World War II,
she was bought by Burke Stodger.

765
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:46,380
Burke Stodger. Burke Stodger the actor?
.45-Caliber Kissoff Burke Stodger?

766
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,945
The movie star.

767
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,111
What?

768
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,700
He gets blacklisted because of his politics
and branded a communist.

769
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,260
So he takes the boat,
splits the country...

770
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,420
which is where
your Bermuda Triangle comes in.

771
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,544
Hi. I'm Chlorinda. How can I help you?

772
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,180
Well, I'm gonna have
the house anchovy loaf to start...

773
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,300
and... the devil ray filet.

774
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,820
Can I get that deep-fried
in beer batter?

775
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,060
It's your stomach.
What can I get for you, little buddy?

776
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,340
I'll take the jellyfish teriyaki
croquettes and the eel Trovatore, please.

777
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,220
Okay. And to drink, gentlemen?

778
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,540
You'll wanna get fucked up
before this meal.

779
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,740
That's for sure.

780
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,380
I have some recommendations.
Maybe the... Tequila Zombie.

781
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,900
- Make it two.
- All right.

782
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,511
Thank you.

783
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,069
So Burke's blacklisted, takes the boat,
splits the country.

784
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,060
Somewhere between San Pedro and Papeete,
the boat disappears...

785
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,900
till one day a couple years later...

786
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,220
the boat and the owner
suddenly reappear.

787
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,460
You dig?

788
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,028
The Preserved is in
the opposite ocean, off of Cuba...

789
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,060
and Burke Stodger on the front page
of the Daily Variety...

790
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,940
in an article reporting
his return to pictures...

791
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,462
in a major motion picture
called Commie Confidential.

792
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,580
Whoa. So Burke's working again.

793
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,300
And his politics have
miraculously changed.

794
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,547
And the ship?

795
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,060
Man, they removed any traces
of soul that she once had.

796
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,500
It's a horror story.

797
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,309
Are you emotionally involved?
With the boat?

798
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,141
She's not just a boat, Doc.

799
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,148
She's much more than that.

800
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,820
All right.

801
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,467
Well, I know why I'm so interested.

802
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,420
But why are you?

803
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,908
A story I heard the other night,
something about a smuggling angle.

804
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,460
And the story you heard...

805
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,027
did it happen to include
Mickey Wolfmann?

806
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,746
Not so far. Why?

807
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,180
According to scuttlebutt,
shortly before he disappeared...

808
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,700
Mickey Wolfmann was seen taking
the Golden Fang out for a three-hour tour.

809
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,940
Or should I say:

810
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,420
A three-hour tour

811
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,829
And... was he accompanied
by his lovely companion?

812
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,900
Okay.

813
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,140
- My fucking ex, old Shasta Fay?
- I know.

814
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,740
I know who she is. But, Doc, I thought
you were done with all that sad bullshit.

815
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,180
Listen, did everybody make it back okay?

816
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,540
Nobody was pushed overboard,
nothing like that?

817
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,500
Actually, the word I'm hearing is that Mickey
Wolfmann might not be as missing as we think.

818
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,623
Like gone but not gone?

819
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,871
Man, you're gonna love this.

820
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,380
The rumor is that the Department
of Justice is trying to broker...

821
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,660
Here you go.

822
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,986
Thank you.

823
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,220
I'm hearing
that the Department of Justice...

824
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,100
is trying to broker
a Vegas deal for him.

825
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,224
Doesn't compute. Say again.
Vegas. Wolfmann.

826
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,740
FBI stuff.

827
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,706
They need somebody else
on the Strip who's not Italian.

828
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,340
You dig?

829
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,589
Like Howard Hughes
when he bought the Desert Inn.

830
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,066
Howard Hughes was Italian?

831
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,144
No. They want white people.

832
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,941
They want white,
Anglo owners on the Strip.

833
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,708
Who better than Mickey Wolfmann?

834
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,300
Hello?

835
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,821
Hello?

836
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,220
All right, Doc.

837
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,060
So she just departed San Pedro
on board the Golden Fang.

838
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,580
- Who?
- Your ex, Shasta Fay.

839
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,780
Shasta's on the Golden Fang?

840
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,820
My friend in the DOJ
just called me, yeah.

841
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,183
- All right, where's it going?
- Out at sea some place.

842
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,300
Out at sea some place and...

843
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,700
Yeah, where?

844
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,585
Not known. Not known.

845
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,100
Hang tight. I'm gonna get back to you.

846
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,348
All right, cool. Call me...

847
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,108
Penny Kimball, Deputy DA.

848
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,220
Hey.

849
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,271
Who is this?

850
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,100
It's me.

851
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,109
Where did you get this number?

852
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,309
It's Doc.

853
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,266
I thought you'd never want
to speak to me again.

854
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,540
Didn't...

855
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,140
I didn't mind talking to the FBI.

856
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,024
Am I in trouble?

857
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,143
I don't know. Are you?

858
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,787
It's an awful nice night
out here at the beach.

859
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,140
But you're a dirty, filthy hippie.

860
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,150
What would a nice clean girl
like me do with you?

861
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,340
Well, you could...

862
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,749
bring your soap and clean my feet.

863
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,300
Ew.

864
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,070
No, thank you.

865
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,506
But then again,
I could bring you a pizza.

866
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,260
I can hear your pants growing.

867
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,140
So...?

868
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,580
I'll be there in an hour.

869
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,300
And wash your feet first.

870
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,420
...problems for which government has...

871
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,746
Freedom.

872
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,260
Heavy on the "dumb."

873
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,420
The moral and spiritual crisis in
the universities would still exist.

874
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,900
The destructive activists
of our universities...

875
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,100
That's the best thing
I've heard all day.

876
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,380
You want one?

877
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,460
Nixon downplayed the antiwar message...

878
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,260
inherent in the New Year's
bombers' attack.

879
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,180
When he called on the Vigilant California
to take back cities and universities...

880
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,220
he was interrupted by a heckler.

881
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,020
Hey! Tricky Dick! Fuck you!

882
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,260
You listen to me when I say that to you!

883
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,543
Fuck you! Fuck everybody in the family!

884
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,871
Now, what the fuck?

885
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,900
He's identified as unemployed
UCLA student Rick Doppel.

886
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,420
- Who?
- Oh, Doppler? That's no hippie.

887
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,224
That's Chucky.

888
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,500
Yeah? Is it a friend of yours?

889
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,900
Secret Service took the man
for questioning...

890
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,420
Everybody knows Chucky.

891
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,306
If he's not at the Hall of Justice,
he's down at the Glass House.

892
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,910
A snitch?

893
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,380
An informant, please.

894
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,980
And he only works with the Red Squad.

895
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:20,381
Whoa. So, what's he...? Why is he screaming
and yelling like that at Nixon again?

896
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,580
Now that he's been on TV,
he has instant and wide credibility.

897
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,023
Police can infiltrate him
into any group they want to.

898
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,703
Bastards.

899
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,306
- Do you love me?
- Any group.

900
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,660
A snitch. A spy. A weasel.

901
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,220
And dang...

902
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:53,340
if it ain't a resurrected tenor sax player,
working undercover.

903
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,100
But for who?

904
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,220
These patriotic pals of President Nixon
called Vigilant California?

905
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,900
Some other unseen hand?

906
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,980
Now, who am I again?

907
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,020
You're the photographer.

908
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:09,900
- And the name of the magazine is...?
- Stone Turntable.

909
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,980
Coy's band, The Boards, were currently
renting a place in Topanga Canyon...

910
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,020
from a bass player turned
record company executive...

911
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,180
which trend watchers took as further
evidence of the end of Hollywood...

912
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,304
if not the world, as they had known it.

913
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,660
Doc and Denis hadn't dropped acid
for years in this town...

914
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,220
without picking up
some kind of extrasensory chops.

915
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,700
And truth was, since crossing
the doorsill of this place...

916
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,827
they couldn't help noticing
what you would call an atmosphere.

917
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,386
Thank you.

918
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,380
What are you doing here?

919
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,340
I drove up with Bambi.
She heard Spotted Dick were here...

920
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,980
so I had to come along
and keep her out of trouble.

921
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,100
She's possessed. She's got
Spotted Dick posters on the walls...

922
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,380
sheets and pillow cases,
T-shirts, souvenir roach clips.

923
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,180
All right, she's keen on the Dick.

924
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,140
It's 24 hours a day.
She's got Spotted Dick albums on stereo.

925
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,380
Okay, yeah, now listen.

926
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,860
I'm looking for that guy that I met
at Club Asiatique the other night.

927
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,700
- He's here.
- Yeah? Where?

928
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,426
- He's in the kitchen.
- The kitchen?

929
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,900
Hey, before you leave.
Can I get a ride with you?

930
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,500
This place is freaking me out.

931
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,940
Okay.

932
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,100
Good evening, Larry Sportello,
Stone Turntable magazine.

933
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,305
Smedley, Spotted Dick, keyboards.

934
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,620
Was it possible
that at every gathering...

935
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:48,340
Concert, peace rally,
love-in, be-in and freak-in...

936
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,900
here, up North, back East, wherever.

937
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,020
...some dark crews
had been busy all along...

938
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,220
reclaiming the music,
the resistance to power...

939
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,300
the sexual desire
from epic to everyday...

940
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,461
all they could sweep up,
for the ancient forces of greed and fear.

941
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,464
"Gee, " he thought, "I don't know."

942
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,701
Hey.

943
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,711
Hi.

944
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,580
Hi there. Remember me, Larry Sportello?

945
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,980
Stone Turntable magazine?

946
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,821
You... asked me to... look into that...

947
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,940
vehicle.

948
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,746
- What?
- The vehicle?

949
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,220
Yeah, what was the make and model
that you looked at again?

950
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:41,140
You were asking
about that older type VW...

951
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,060
with the hearts and blue birds and...

952
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,540
Any replacement parts?

953
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,900
None I could see.

954
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,260
What about street legal?

955
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,540
Was it any hassles with registration?

956
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,664
Didn't seem to be any...

957
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,820
- You saw Hope?
- Yeah, for a minute.

958
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,460
She's okay.

959
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,660
Looks like she's been staying clean too.

960
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,100
How'd she do it?

961
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,740
I don't know. She's...
back teaching is all she said.

962
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,700
You know, public health,
drug awareness, something like that.

963
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,340
- Where?
- Where? I don't know.

964
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,190
She didn't say.

965
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,100
It doesn't matter.

966
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,220
No way I could ever go back to them.

967
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:25,740
All right, man.
Look, you can't go back to them?

968
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,540
Who? Because what? Why?

969
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,420
Because it would be my ass
and my family's too.

970
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,980
It's like a gang. It's like once
you're in, you're in for life.

971
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,820
Did you know that when you signed up?

972
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,620
All I knew was we couldn't do each other
any good staying together.

973
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,340
The baby looked like shit,
getting worse every day.

974
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:48,260
We were just getting fucked up
and sitting there and saying:

975
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,020
"Well, we gotta do something.

976
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,190
You're dragging us down, and..."

977
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,380
Listen, I'm not asking you
to give away any secrets here.

978
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,551
But I think I saw you on the tube
at a rally for Nixon.

979
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,220
And your question is,
which side am I on?

980
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,751
Yes.

981
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,300
Well, you know,
these people here have money.

982
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,100
It's not like those Bible freaks that go up
and down the beach, like, screaming at you.

983
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,580
They really wanna help.

984
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,860
I thought it was something good
to do for my country.

985
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,420
Stupid as that sounds.

986
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,500
But what I really found out was...

987
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:32,580
they just wanna, like, use us
and keep the membership in line.

988
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,980
"My country, right or wrong"
with Vietnam going on...

989
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,387
it's just fucking crazy.

990
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,430
Suppose your mom was on smack.

991
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,620
My mom?

992
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,780
Yeah, what would you do?

993
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,302
- You know, wouldn't you try to help her?
- Yeah. I think...

994
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,500
Are you saying that the U.S.
is somebody's mom?

995
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,460
And she's... strung out?

996
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,500
- I'm trying to...
- On what?

997
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,660
On sending people off to die
in jungles for no reason.

998
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,420
Something wrong and suicidal about that
that she can't stop.

999
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,860
And Vigilant California, or whoever it is
you're working for, wouldn't buy that?

1000
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,110
I don't belong here, man.

1001
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,380
I do get the feeling
you'd rather be someplace else.

1002
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,550
Yeah. Back where I was would be nice.

1003
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,540
See, if I did just run a fast check...

1004
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,780
and happened to find some angle
that you haven't thought of...

1005
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:45,460
Listen, nothing personal, but there's
too much you haven't thought of.

1006
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,580
Man, I can dig.
You're trying to chase me off of this.

1007
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,260
Whatever it is that you're caught inside,
I'm out here on the outside of it.

1008
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,940
And I can, you know, move in ways
that you may not be able to.

1009
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,020
How'd the baby look? Amethyst.

1010
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,340
Oh, man. A sweetie pie.

1011
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,700
- She looked good?
- Yeah.

1012
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,620
- No sign of them little kid blues?
- "Little kid blues"?

1013
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,580
No, that happens. They get that.

1014
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,260
Yeah. No, none I could see...

1015
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,340
You saw it a little bit.
I blew this solo, man.

1016
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,820
Listen, who set you up
with these people?

1017
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,780
Where did it come from?

1018
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,620
I mean, come on. Gimme a glimpse here, man.
Who set you up with these people?

1019
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,420
When I first started Snitching...

1020
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:25,460
I realized how often people asked questions
they already know the answers to.

1021
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,940
They just wanna hear it
from another voice.

1022
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,660
Like one outside their head.

1023
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,670
You better find Shasta Fay.

1024
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,662
Shasta Fay.

1025
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,060
Thanks for the lift, boys.

1026
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,700
See you around. Jade. Jade.

1027
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,580
You said in your note,
"Beware of the Golden Fang."

1028
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,670
Why am I supposed to beware of a boat?

1029
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,426
They're an Indochinese heroin cartel.

1030
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,980
A vertical package.

1031
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:43,700
They grow it, bring it in, step on it, run
stateside networks of local street dealers...

1032
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,347
and take a separate percentage
off of each operation.

1033
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,100
So you're dealing smack?

1034
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,431
No, but they use Chick Planet
as a front to launder money.

1035
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,785
See you around.

1036
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,140
Reluctant, maybe even
a little desperate...

1037
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,991
Doc figured
he had to go visit Bigfoot now.

1038
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,980
On principle, he tried to spend as little
time around the Glass House as possible.

1039
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,780
All this strange alternate cop history
and cop politics...

1040
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,580
Cop dynasties,
cop heroes and evildoers...

1041
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,580
saintly cops and psycho cops...

1042
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:29,060
cops too stupid to live
and cops too smart for their own good.

1043
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,660
...insulated by secret loyalties
and codes of silence...

1044
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,545
from the world
they'd all been given to control.

1045
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,620
Bigfoot's native element.
The air he breathed.

1046
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:46,224
The big time he'd been so crazy to get away
from the beach and be promoted into.

1047
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,100
Then why so grumpy, Bigfoot?

1048
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,300
Doc remembered dimly
a story from long past.

1049
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,580
A rumor about a partner of Bigfoot's...

1050
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,260
who'd been shot and killed
a while back in the line of duty.

1051
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,940
And ever since then, the story went...

1052
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,427
Bigfoot had worked alone.

1053
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,100
I hope this won't be another one of those
unabridged paranoid hippie monologues...

1054
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,300
I seem obliged to sit through.

1055
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,629
So, what if someone dies,
but is resurrected?

1056
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,671
Not, at first glance,
a matter for Homicide.

1057
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,462
So who around here
handles resurrections?

1058
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,980
Bunco Squad, usually.

1059
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,140
Does that mean the L.A.P.D. believes every
return from the dead is some kind of con?

1060
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,184
You're dead, you're dead.
Are we talking philosophy?

1061
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,180
That there is Coy Harlingen,
the stiff in question.

1062
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,667
That was taken last night.

1063
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,020
Remind me why I give a shit again?

1064
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,140
He worked for the department
as a snitch...

1065
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,982
not to mention some patriotic badasses
known as Vigilant California.

1066
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,260
They may have been in on the raid
at Channel View Estates.

1067
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,791
Remember that place, Bigfoot?

1068
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,706
All right.

1069
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,542
All right, I'll look into it personally.

1070
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,063
Sometimes,
it's just about doing the right thing.

1071
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,900
Who are you?

1072
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,909
Clancy Charlock.

1073
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,540
Glen Charlock's sister, mother, sis...

1074
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,820
Sister.

1075
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,960
"Saster."

1076
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,270
I'm so sorry about your... brother.

1077
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,140
Glen was a shit.

1078
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,180
Bound to have his series
canceled sometime.

1079
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,500
That don't keep me from wanting
to know who his killer is.

1080
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:17,220
Goodness. Did you talk to the police?

1081
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,580
They talked to me.
Some smart-ass named Bigfoot.

1082
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:24,940
He seemed less concerned with Glen's murder
than Mickey Wolfmann's disappearance.

1083
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,188
But he's a fan of yours all right.

1084
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,220
Said you might be able to help.

1085
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,990
Did he now?

1086
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,860
Did you hear the Wolfmann's working
on a way to give away all his money?

1087
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,824
Why would he wanna do that?

1088
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,780
He was on a guilt trip, man.

1089
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,267
Doing tons of acid and peyote and...

1090
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,860
Just got to a point. He felt bad...

1091
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,223
about making people pay
for cheap houses.

1092
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,703
Are you gonna keep holding on
to that tank or you gonna marry it?

1093
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,220
He wanted to build this place
in the desert...

1094
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,540
where people could come and live for free,
called the Arrepentimiento.

1095
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,140
Arrepentimiento.

1096
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,300
And now, what's that mean again?

1097
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,309
Spanish for "sorry about that."

1098
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,900
Do you think that...

1099
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,340
you know, maybe your brother
was just...

1100
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,020
you know, doing his job
to try to prevent...

1101
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,820
whoever it was
from putting the snatch on Mickey?

1102
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,300
That's way too fucking sentimental.

1103
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,186
Sounds like somebody objected
to Mickey's big giveaway.

1104
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,940
The... wife?

1105
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,029
Business partners?

1106
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,820
Puck Beaverton.

1107
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,020
He had the duty that day
to guard Mickey.

1108
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,780
But changed shifts with Glen
at the last minute.

1109
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,940
Puck Beaverton.
Interesting fellow, I hear.

1110
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,700
He's a major-league asshole.

1111
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,100
Sounds like you dated.

1112
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,825
Him and his roommate.

1113
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,346
Two at a time?

1114
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,186
That's my preference.

1115
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,145
Well, you know where I might be able
to find this... Puck fella?

1116
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,860
Dropped out of sight
after Glen's murder.

1117
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,061
Set sail.

1118
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,700
"Set sail"? Like on a boat?

1119
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,063
I don't know. Maybe.

1120
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,704
If you find him, you'll let me know?

1121
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:44,109
Well... perhaps we should continue
this conversación someplace else.

1122
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,111
I've got a date.

1123
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,300
Thank you.

1124
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,660
Oh, and Miss Charlock.

1125
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,740
I just need your contact information
from you.

1126
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,988
- Sure.
- Okay. Here's a pen.

1127
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,260
Hey, Glance...

1128
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,100
did Glen ever mention
one of Mickey's ladies...

1129
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,100
who goes by the name of Shasta?

1130
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,660
The girl who's gone missing?

1131
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,260
- That's her.
- Yeah.

1132
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,300
She was in love with him.
Deeply in love.

1133
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,902
Oh, Shasta and Doc lived together
for a short while.

1134
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,060
Bummer.

1135
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,260
Well, as someone who's been down
this particular exit ramp:

1136
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,060
You can only cruise
the boulevards of regret so far.

1137
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,620
Then you gotta get back up
onto the freeway again.

1138
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,981
Yeah.

1139
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,146
Good luck.

1140
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,022
- See you.
- Bye now.

1141
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,231
I wish you could see these waves.

1142
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,704
It's one more of these places a voice from
somewhere else tells you you have to be.

1143
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,386
Remember that day with the Ouija board?

1144
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,540
I miss those days...

1145
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,469
and I miss you.

1146
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,110
Nothing was supposed
to happen this way, Doc.

1147
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,662
I'm so sorry.

1148
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,787
You don't remember
the Ouija board, do you, Doc?

1149
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,228
It had been one
of those prolonged times of no dope.

1150
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,069
You think it knows where we can score?

1151
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,747
Ask.

1152
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,060
Just do it by yourself like that.

1153
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:04,740
Nobody had any. Everybody was desperate
and suffering lapses of judgment.

1154
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,820
Eight-4-2-9-3.

1155
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,547
- It's a phone number!
- One-2-5-0-1.

1156
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,500
It's ringing.

1157
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,220
Howdy, dopers.
We've got whatever you need.

1158
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,900
And remember: the sooner you get over here,
the more there'll be left for you.

1159
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,220
So come on down to 4723 Sunset Boulevard.
You better hurry.

1160
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,540
Okay, I'm sorry,
who is it that I'm talking to?

1161
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,900
- She hung up.
- Let's go!

1162
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,628
She's screaming at you:
"Stay away! I'm a police trap!"

1163
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,741
Aw, there's a problem with Ouija boards.

1164
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,700
Shasta!

1165
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,191
That board sure did its work.

1166
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:19,340
They didn't score any dope that day,
but somehow, suddenly, it didn't matter.

1167
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,460
It was weird that in the limited space
of a postcard...

1168
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,780
Shasta should have chosen
to remember that one day in the rain.

1169
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,180
It had stuck with Doc too...

1170
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,260
even though it was late
in their time together...

1171
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,748
when she was already
halfway out the door.

1172
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,425
Hey, Denis?

1173
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,620
Denis, I'm-a go look around.

1174
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,820
Wanna wait in the car
or come cover my back?

1175
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,380
I was gonna try to go find a pizza.
Is that okay?

1176
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,740
Now you recall this is stick shift,
not automatic and so forth?

1177
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,590
It's easy as pie, Doc.

1178
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,060
Good afternoon.

1179
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,740
This is the address they gave me
at Club Asiatique in San Pedro.

1180
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,308
Just here to pick up a package
for the management.

1181
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,461
Hello, this is Xandra from front desk.

1182
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,862
We have a pickup for management.

1183
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,386
Follow me.

1184
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,780
Dr. Blatnoyd will see you in a moment.

1185
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,700
So you have some ID, I imagine?

1186
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,900
I don't know what this is. What is it?

1187
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,502
It's oriental or something.
Is it Chinese?

1188
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:57,310
Well, I figured... you being Chinese...

1189
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,027
What? What are you talking about?

1190
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,506
The Golden Fang?

1191
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,030
It's a syndicate.

1192
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,140
Most of us happen to be dentists.

1193
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:17,020
A syndicate of dentists
set up long ago for tax purposes.

1194
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,710
All legit.

1195
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,910
Where did you tell Xandra
you were from again?

1196
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,501
Why, you're another one
of those hippie dope fiends, aren't you?

1197
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,380
My goodness. My goodness me.

1198
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,186
Here for a little perking up, are we?

1199
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,831
Dig it.

1200
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,180
It's from Darmstadt.

1201
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,380
Lab quality.

1202
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,220
I try not to do any dope
I can't pay for, is what it is.

1203
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:02,340
No, no, on the house! In fact, maybe I'm
gonna even join you for one little moment.

1204
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,660
Well, just to be sociable.

1205
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,860
There you go.

1206
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,420
Doctor, I think there's a problem
with the couch in your office.

1207
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,702
And bring that bottle.

1208
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,622
What do you think of my chompers?

1209
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,500
Heroin sucks the calcium
out of your body like a vampire.

1210
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,749
If you use it for any length of time,
your teeth go all to hell.

1211
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,989
And that's just the good part.

1212
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,541
Doc!

1213
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,781
Doc?

1214
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,426
Dr. Rudy, I'm back.

1215
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,149
You're not Dr. Rudy.

1216
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,509
You're not Dr. Rudy.

1217
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,182
That's at Japonica, ain't it?

1218
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,702
Japonica Fenway?

1219
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,060
Imagine meeting you here.

1220
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,660
Doc rooted through the city dump
that was his memory...

1221
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:51,149
recalling that Japonica here had been
a pretty open-and-shut runaway daughter case.

1222
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,180
Hardly worth daily scale...

1223
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,620
let alone the extravagant bonus
her father, Crocker Fenway...

1224
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:02,020
had insisted on paying when Doc
finally brought Japonica back home.

1225
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,820
So, what have you been up to?

1226
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,220
Escaping, mostly.

1227
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,620
And I escape real good.

1228
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,380
Escaping what?

1229
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:15,620
Chryskylodon. This, like, booby hatch
my parents keep sending me to.

1230
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,140
"Booby hatch"?

1231
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,260
- Up in Ojai?
- You know it?

1232
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,383
Shakes a tambourine.

1233
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,620
Dr. Rudy!

1234
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,700
Okay. All right.

1235
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,900
Japonica, you promised me.
Did you not promise me?

1236
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,140
- What are you doing here?
- I escaped again for you.

1237
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,420
Oof! Woo-hoo!

1238
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,100
Look at the greedy little hippie.
Snorting away, are you?

1239
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,940
- Your parents know you're here?
- No.

1240
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,300
The Fenways? They were
heavy-duty South Bay money...

1241
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:50,580
and led lives of unusually high density
and often incoherence.

1242
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,780
Her father, Crocker, also known
as the Dark Prince of Palos Verdes...

1243
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,780
was a lead lawyer at the office
of Voorhees-Krueger...

1244
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,790
who had given Doc
his first paying gig as a PI.

1245
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,900
Man, like, I'm sorry.

1246
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,660
Denis, what is it this time?
That's my steering wheel?

1247
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,860
- I don't know how to drive.
- Aw, man, I thought you said you...

1248
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,580
Hey.

1249
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,380
Smile Maintenance Chick.

1250
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,660
How lovely.

1251
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,620
Miss Fenway may appear
a little psychotic today.

1252
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,867
Groovy.

1253
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,140
- What?
- It's groovy being insane, man.

1254
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,540
Where you at?

1255
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,620
It's not groovy to be insane.

1256
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,140
Japonica here has been
institutionalized for it.

1257
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,980
Okay, come on now, Denis. We've gotta
figure out a way back to the beach.

1258
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,023
If you need a ride,
I'm heading that way.

1259
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,980
Cop friendly,
everything cool with your ride?

1260
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,100
Brake lights, license plate, so forth?

1261
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,580
A-okay.

1262
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,540
Mind if I tag along with you guys?
Contingencies of the road and so forth?

1263
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,780
That's a good idea. Maybe we should
do more of that, tsk, tsk, for the road?

1264
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,180
Yes. Yeah. You want some?

1265
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,740
Excuse me.

1266
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,987
Come on.

1267
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,300
What's in that bag
you're stuffing under Doc's seat?

1268
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,824
Pay no attention to that bag.
It'll only make everybody paranoid.

1269
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,660
Though he may have rescued Japonica...

1270
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,260
from a life of dark
and unspecified hippie horror...

1271
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,140
apparently restoration
to the bosom of her family...

1272
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,700
had been enough
to really drive her around the bend.

1273
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,580
Oh, fuck!

1274
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,660
- Fucking assholes!
- Easy, easy.

1275
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,140
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I can't...

1276
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:30,220
- Okay, we are so fucked! I got...
- Nice and easy.

1277
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,388
Christ, Christ. Some...

1278
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,380
Are you the Great Beast?

1279
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,060
No, no, that's a policeman.

1280
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,260
You were driving
without your headlights.

1281
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,300
But I can see in the dark.

1282
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,580
Perhaps you shouldn't be driving, then.

1283
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,820
- I'm gonna need to see all your IDs.
- What is this all about, sir?

1284
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,380
Any gathering of three or more civilians
is considered a possible cult.

1285
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,900
What? It's Charlie Manson again?

1286
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,740
Criteria includes reference
to the Book of Revelation...

1287
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,820
males with shoulder-length hair...

1288
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:01,700
and endangerment
through inattentive driving...

1289
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,540
all of which has been exhibited.

1290
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,300
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Man, listen.

1291
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,660
This is a Mercedes.
It's only painted one color.

1292
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,300
- Y'all hang tight.
- That should count for something.

1293
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,980
- Good point.
- Okay. All right.

1294
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,220
Okay, okay. Oh, God, I'm actually
gonna have a heart attack.

1295
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,380
Actually my heart
is racing like a little...

1296
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,420
- What?
- Yes, sir?

1297
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,060
I'm gonna hand these in...

1298
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,820
and as long as there aren't
any wants or warrants...

1299
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,980
- ...you won't hear any more about this.
- Thank you, officer.

1300
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,421
- Thank you, sir.
- Drive safely.

1301
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,580
- Here you go, Blat. Dr. Rudy.
- No, that's yours.

1302
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,660
- And Japonica here.
- That's beautiful.

1303
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,740
Denis, take this.

1304
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,465
This one is Denis's.

1305
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,540
Idiots Unlimited.

1306
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,700
Oh, yeah, I'm in an evil mood
myself tonight.

1307
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,580
What can I do?

1308
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,148
Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd, DDS...

1309
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,224
has perpetrated his last root canal,
I'm afraid.

1310
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,740
Hablo inglés, man.
What's that...? He's dead?

1311
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,780
They found him
next to a trampoline in Bel Air...

1312
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,940
with a fatal neck injury.

1313
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:27,580
So far no witnesses,
no motives, no suspects...

1314
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,827
apart from you.

1315
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,300
Not me. Why me?

1316
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,580
You were observed in Blatnoyd's company.

1317
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,900
Both of you riding in a vehicle
full of drug-crazed hippies.

1318
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,020
Yeah, well, you know...

1319
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,980
the owner of that vehicle...

1320
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,260
is a very well-respected... you know,
lawyer down in Palos Verdes.

1321
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,060
And his daughter was driving.
She offered me a ride.

1322
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,340
And cops didn't even give her a ticket.

1323
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:55,140
You know, Blatnoyd
was her friend, not mine.

1324
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,340
Go to bed.

1325
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,861
I'm working. Why am I gonna go to bed?

1326
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,020
I think it's time
we had one of our chats.

1327
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,511
All right. Yup.

1328
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,741
So with this Coy Harlingen matter...

1329
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,100
on the face of it...

1330
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,460
it's one more OD,
one less junkie, case cleared.

1331
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,867
And on the not face of it?

1332
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,102
Why, what do we have here?

1333
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,300
Why don't you pick a card?

1334
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,020
Any card.

1335
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,660
These are field interrogation reports.

1336
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:39,140
See if you find anything
that looks familiar.

1337
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,229
Card tricks.

1338
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,551
No.

1339
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,300
Puck Beaverton.

1340
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,980
Excellent choice.
One of Mickey Wolfmann's bodyguards.

1341
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,540
Interesting fellow, I hear.

1342
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:56,060
Sheriff's people ran into him
at the Venice home...

1343
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:59,140
of the dealer that sold Harlingen
the smack that killed him.

1344
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,700
Or didn't kill him.

1345
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,180
Wait, so, what was Puck doing
at Coy's dealer's place?

1346
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,380
The interesting thing
about this overdose...

1347
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:10,740
is that Leonard James Loosemeat
a.k.a. El Drano...

1348
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:13,140
was known for this 3 percent product...

1349
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,708
yet the report says what killed him
was pure China White Number Four.

1350
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:20,220
Like, from the whole-seller?
Whoever's bringing it in?

1351
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,140
I seem to recall that some years ago,
just before he went into Folsom...

1352
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,186
Beaverton used to work
for this loan shark...

1353
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,340
Adrian Prussia.

1354
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,747
Fucking zoinks! I know Adrian Prussia.

1355
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,940
I know him from my skip-tracing days.

1356
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:39,747
He's a bad man. Used a baseball bat.
You know, he's sick.

1357
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,580
And Coy's dealer, El Drano...

1358
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,784
also happened
to be Prussia's steady customer.

1359
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,386
So maybe Puck was there
on Adrian's behalf.

1360
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,390
What do you think?

1361
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,380
I think you and Adrian have a history
you're not sharing with me.

1362
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,583
Got it, lieutenant!

1363
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,102
You got it, lieutenant.

1364
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:20,540
Pancakes aren't quite as good as my mother's,
but what I really go for here is the respect.

1365
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,020
Respect.

1366
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,666
You didn't get enough of that
from your mom.

1367
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:30,780
You probably imagine that I have a lot
of status up in Robbery-Homicide.

1368
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,631
I mean, who could blame you
for thinking that.

1369
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,463
The reality, however...

1370
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,186
no Cielo Drive for Bigfoot.

1371
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,506
No TV movie rights
or book deals for Bigfoot.

1372
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,946
I mean, even the extra work
is drying up.

1373
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,023
God help us all.

1374
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,020
Dentists on trampolines.

1375
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,780
You know, Dr. Blatnoyd
had puncture wounds on his throat...

1376
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,980
consistent with bites
from canines of a midsize wild animal.

1377
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,180
That's what the coroner told me!

1378
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,860
Swallow that!

1379
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,301
Listen, that's mighty weird, Bigfoot.

1380
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,380
Okay? Because Blatnoyd
was a partner in a tax dodge...

1381
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,982
that calls itself
The Golden Fang Enterprises.

1382
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,220
You didn't happen to get the... SID to test
those neck punctures for gold or nothing?

1383
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,540
I shouldn't think there'd be much trace.

1384
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:33,020
Gold is all but chemically inactive, as you
might have learned in chemistry class...

1385
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,383
if you hadn't been ditching all the time
to score dope, Sportello.

1386
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,580
Every contact leaves traces.

1387
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,900
It would sure be ironic,
is all I'm saying...

1388
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,020
if Blatnoyd was bit to death
by a golden fang...

1389
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,820
or, like, even better,
like, two golden fangs?

1390
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,460
I don't see why any of this
would be material.

1391
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,300
Because it's the Golden Fang.

1392
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:56,060
- It's the decedent's tax shelter. So, what?
- No, man, it's not a tax shelter.

1393
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:01,221
It's something,
Bigfoot, man, much more, more vast.

1394
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:06,300
This wouldn't be just more
of your paranoid hippie bullshit, would it?

1395
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:09,260
Look, have the lab check
for traces of copper.

1396
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,180
Not the kind that goes stumbling all over
the crime scene contaminating evidence.

1397
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:14,620
More like copper the metal.

1398
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:17,180
You see, gold teeth are never made
with pure gold.

1399
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,100
Dentists like to alloy it with copper.

1400
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:23,740
If you hadn't ditched forensics class to go steal
hubcaps to plant on some innocent hippie...

1401
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,749
you might have known that.

1402
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,551
Oh, you feel like
a cop almost, don't you?

1403
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:36,105
Good day.

1404
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,271
Okay, it's coming!

1405
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,980
So where to?

1406
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:54,340
A place up in Ojai called Chryskylodon.

1407
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,020
Chryskylodon?

1408
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,063
"Animal tooth."

1409
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,940
Ancient Indian word, Sortilège?
It means "serenity."

1410
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,980
I minored in the Classics.
It's not Indian, it's Ancient Greek.

1411
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:10,662
It means "animal tooth
made out of gold."

1412
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,949
You're doing good, Doc.

1413
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,301
- Thanks, Lège.
- Okay.

1414
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:29,940
Owing to Governor Reagan's shutdown
of most of the state mental facilities...

1415
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:34,260
the private sector had been given
carte blanche to pick up the slack.

1416
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:38,780
Soon, in fact, becoming a standard
California child-rearing resource...

1417
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,780
for kids like that old Japonica Fenway.

1418
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,900
Mr. Sportello.

1419
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,100
- Dr. Aubrey Threeply.
- Oh, how do you do?

1420
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,100
- So good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

1421
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,420
- Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you.

1422
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:54,260
Would you...? Sorry.
Would you like to use the facilities?

1423
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:57,940
You already used the bathroom?
Before we take a tour of the facility?

1424
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,820
This is my colleague Dr. Lily Hammer.

1425
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,660
- Mr. Sportello.
- How do you do?

1426
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:02,900
Thank you.

1427
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,590
Please join us.

1428
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,180
This is our administrative lounge.

1429
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:11,140
Our Chenin blanc comes
from the institute's own vineyard.

1430
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:15,500
Hands steady as a rock today I see,
Kimberly.

1431
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,020
So happy you noticed, Dr. Threeply.

1432
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:20,700
- More soup?
- Yes, if you know what's good for you.

1433
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:24,980
Have you been with us before, Mr. Sportello?
I know I've seen your face.

1434
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:28,980
First time I've been down here. Normally,
I don't get much south of South City.

1435
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:31,262
And abnormally?

1436
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:32,980
What?

1437
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:37,100
Well, I only meant that with any number
of qualified facilities in the Bay Area...

1438
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,940
why even bother coming
all the way down here to us?

1439
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,587
My clients believe
that Ojai is a planetary chakra.

1440
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,220
Chryskylodon's motion picture palace.

1441
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,540
Now showing the Burke Stodger marathon.

1442
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:04,586
All Burke, all day, 24 hours of Stodger.

1443
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,900
...people's museum.
And I warn you once more...

1444
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,220
This place is a lie.

1445
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,071
This is particularly popular
with the patients.

1446
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,630
These marvels?

1447
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,060
This! This was not invented
by a Russian.

1448
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:21,940
The man's name was Bell!
Alexander Graham Bell!

1449
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,340
And he was an American!

1450
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,190
Get that, comrade.

1451
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,540
Everything on this table is as phony
as the town.

1452
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,780
The rotten system you call communism.

1453
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,660
It was occurring to Doc now...

1454
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:40,020
something Jade said once
about vertical integration...

1455
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:43,700
that if the Golden Fang
can get its customers strung out...

1456
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,100
why not turn around
and sell them a program to help kick?

1457
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,820
Get them coming and going.

1458
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:50,940
Twice as much revenue.

1459
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,020
As long as American life
was something to be escaped from...

1460
01:33:55,120 --> 01:34:00,300
the cartel could always be sure
of a bottomless pool of new customers.

1461
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,424
Any questions?

1462
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:38,420
Is that a swastika on that man's face?

1463
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,820
No, it isn't.

1464
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:45,389
That's an ancient Hindu symbol
meaning "All is well."

1465
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:49,769
It brings good fortune,
luck and well-being.

1466
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,711
What do you mean?

1467
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,700
Only that it looked like
a swastika to me.

1468
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,109
Well, he isn't a regular employee
of the Institute.

1469
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,584
Perhaps you should pay
no attention to that man.

1470
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,300
What the fuck?

1471
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,340
...encapsulated in the charming phrase:

1472
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,100
Which means, of course,
"You must be very tired."

1473
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:30,060
Which brings us to the institute's
own Zen garden imported from Kyoto.

1474
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:33,900
But each textured pebble,
each grain of white sand...

1475
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,140
was transported and reassembled here
exactly in place...

1476
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:40,025
by a team of some
of our more obsessive patients.

1477
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,151
Mickey.

1478
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,467
Mickey.

1479
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,861
Mickey.

1480
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:48,142
Hello, little hippie.

1481
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,227
How are you?

1482
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,510
What are you doing here?

1483
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,263
They're helping me.

1484
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:05,869
They're helping me wake up
from my bad hippie dream.

1485
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,824
Well, what'd you dream about?

1486
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:18,589
I dreamed I gave away all my money.

1487
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,546
Yeah.

1488
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,270
Who brought you here?

1489
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,184
My friends.

1490
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:36,791
Who are your friends? The FBI?

1491
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,986
I spent my whole life...

1492
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:48,260
I spent my whole life
making people pay for shelter.

1493
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:51,703
And all along, I didn't realize...

1494
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:58,786
I didn't realize
it was supposed to be for free.

1495
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,704
For free.

1496
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,745
Where's Shasta?

1497
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:18,304
What? Tell me, did she come with you?

1498
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,344
Is she here?

1499
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,422
Mickey, where the fuck is Shasta?

1500
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,743
Go away, little hippie.

1501
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,265
Go away.

1502
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,424
"A new casino, a hotel,
25,000 square feet...

1503
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,100
nine dining places,
race and sport booking...

1504
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:49,380
shopping, a spa, local swimming pools...

1505
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,344
and a wedding chapel.

1506
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:56,222
Wolfmann hopes to attract
many Hollywood celebrities."

1507
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,228
1-Adam-12, handle code 3.

1508
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,100
We don't have much to go on.
Just the broadcast Barrett put out.

1509
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,180
He was ambushed by two male Negroes,
possibly on foot.

1510
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,220
He thinks he wounded both of them,
but we can't be sure.

1511
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,700
Far as I know,
we have two units, code 100.

1512
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,980
Aw, Bigfoot, you're adorable.

1513
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,660
I'm sure I got them. Both of them.

1514
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,740
The rest of us can shake
the area on foot.

1515
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,865
Johnson, you and your partner stay here
and preserve the scene for the investigators.

1516
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:52,145
Let's go.

1517
01:39:53,080 --> 01:39:54,670
Hi, Shasta.

1518
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:57,871
Hi, Doc.

1519
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:06,660
Well, either I'm on the time machine...

1520
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,300
or you're back.

1521
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,862
I've been away.

1522
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,500
- Where you been?
- Up north.

1523
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,384
Family stuff.

1524
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,706
Anything been happening down here?

1525
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:32,140
Your friend in the...
construction business?

1526
01:40:32,240 --> 01:40:34,340
Oh, that's all over.

1527
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:37,860
He's back with Sloane and the kids.
And so what?

1528
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:43,820
You know you got a load of people
out looking for you, Shasta.

1529
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,260
Well, here I am.

1530
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,500
C'est la vie.

1531
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:48,900
C'est la vie.

1532
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,780
Que se fucking sera sera.

1533
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,348
Something like that.

1534
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,589
Well, I like your necklace.

1535
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,389
Can't be good.

1536
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:22,340
Yeah, word is your girl's back in town.

1537
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:25,669
Oh, yeah? Well, that's news to me.

1538
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,025
Where you been?

1539
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,740
No place I'd recommend.

1540
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:35,180
Any developments
on the Coy Harlingen matter?

1541
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,860
Like you give a shit?

1542
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,460
Any of them include Prussia or Beaverton
or any of the fuckers that I've given you?

1543
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,580
All right, forget that. Listen, listen.

1544
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:46,101
Any results on those fang marks?

1545
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:49,660
Coroner's people got very upset with me
for suggesting more lab work.

1546
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:56,900
Well, I just thought it'd be a helpful tip
to a fellow professional.

1547
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,785
- You know?
- Oh, really? How's that, Sportello?

1548
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:03,945
Yeah, when your own...
hearing comes up.

1549
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,790
What are you suggesting?

1550
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:15,824
One county supervisor with a bug up his ass
is all it takes to bring you down, Bigfoot.

1551
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,460
This is Mrs. Chastity Bjornsen...

1552
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,340
and if that is one more sociopathic
"special employee" of my husband...

1553
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:33,700
I will thank you
to stop harassing him on his day off.

1554
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,980
It's Sportello.

1555
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:38,980
Oh, Sportello.
Doc Sportello? The Doc Sportello?

1556
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,980
So we meet at last.

1557
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,300
Mr. Moral Fucking Turpitude himself!

1558
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,980
Have you any idea
of the therapist bills around here...

1559
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,140
for which you are directly responsible?

1560
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:50,860
- The department picks up a little.
- Oh, the department?

1561
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,984
Yeah, after a deductible
that would choke a fucking horse.

1562
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,380
All right, you know, he called me.

1563
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:00,780
I fail to understand your spineless response
to that dirty, hippie piece of shit.

1564
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,660
Would you get the fuck up?

1565
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,862
Get the fuck up, Christian.

1566
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,540
Christian, get the fuck up!

1567
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:10,020
- Now, Christian, please!
- Okay.

1568
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:14,862
And would you stop acting like a beaten dog.
I ask you for one fucking day a week.

1569
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,906
No...

1570
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:44,867
What kind of girl do you need, Doc?

1571
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,909
Maybe a thing for one
of those Manson chicks?

1572
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,140
Well, thing is that...

1573
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,380
depends on what...

1574
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:03,660
Are you sure you wanna be doing that?

1575
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:08,060
Submissive, brainwashed, horny, little
teeners who do exactly what you want...

1576
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,627
before you even know what that is.

1577
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:17,861
You don't have to say a word out loud.
They get it all by ESP.

1578
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:20,782
Your kind of chick, Doc?

1579
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:25,101
You the one that's been stealing
my magazines?

1580
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,629
What would Charlie do?

1581
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,102
Well, probably not this.

1582
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:59,780
Listen, I'm sorry about Mickey.

1583
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:01,311
Mickey.

1584
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:10,544
Mickey could have taught all you
swinging beach bums a thing or two.

1585
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:15,430
He was just so powerful.

1586
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,107
Sometimes he could almost
make you feel invisible.

1587
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,145
Fast.

1588
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,866
Brutal.

1589
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:36,342
Not what you'd call a considerate lover.

1590
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,466
But we adored it about him.

1591
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:47,666
Me...

1592
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,863
and Sloane and Luz.

1593
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:02,580
It's so nice to be made to feel
invisible that way sometimes.

1594
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:08,707
And guys just love
to hear shit like this.

1595
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,064
He'd bring me to lunch in Beverly Hills.

1596
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,500
One big hand wrapped
around my bare arm...

1597
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,380
steering me blind
down those bright streets...

1598
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:35,700
into some space
where it was dark and cool.

1599
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:39,302
You couldn't smell any food,
only alcohol.

1600
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,541
He had tables full of them.

1601
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,989
They'd all be drinking...

1602
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:52,941
in a room that could have been any size.

1603
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,262
And they all knew Mickey.

1604
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,307
They wanted, some of them...

1605
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,023
to be Mickey.

1606
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:13,185
He might as well have been
bringing me in on a leash.

1607
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,660
He kept me in those micro-minidresses...

1608
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,943
never allowing me
to wear anything underneath.

1609
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,990
Just offering me up
to whoever wanted...

1610
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,349
to stare...

1611
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:41,390
or grab.

1612
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:47,780
Sometimes, he'd fix me up
with some of his friends...

1613
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:51,985
and I'd have to do whatever they wanted.

1614
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,460
Why are you telling me this?

1615
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,542
I'm sorry, Doc.

1616
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,104
Do you want me to stop?

1617
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,180
If my girlfriend had run off
to be the bought-and-sold whore...

1618
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:13,145
of some scumbag developer...

1619
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,663
I'd just be so angry,
I don't know what I'd do.

1620
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,865
No.

1621
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:33,541
I'm even lying about that.
I know what I'd do.

1622
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,943
If I had the faithless little bitch
over my lap like this...

1623
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,471
This doesn't mean we're back together.

1624
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,790
Of course not.

1625
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:26,986
You didn't get this necklace up North?

1626
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:32,462
I went on a boat ride.

1627
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,028
Like a three-hour tour?

1628
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,460
They told me...

1629
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:48,348
I was precious cargo that couldn't
be insured because of inherent vice.

1630
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:51,025
What's that?

1631
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,150
I don't know.

1632
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:12,348
Kiss me.

1633
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:39,100
"Inherent vice,"
in a marine insurance policy...

1634
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:42,180
is anything that you can't avoid.

1635
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,620
Eggs break...

1636
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,180
chocolate melts...

1637
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,500
glass shatters...

1638
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:52,342
and Doc wondered what that meant
when it applied to ex-old ladies.

1639
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:05,309
What's on your mind, Doc?

1640
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,263
Besides the usual?

1641
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:13,150
I don't know.

1642
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,300
I'm like, you know...

1643
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:22,541
working myself
into a brain freeze here, Lège.

1644
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,540
Well, put it another way:

1645
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:30,391
What's gonna nag at you
in the middle of the night?

1646
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,268
What's gonna nag at me
in the middle of the night?

1647
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,703
Little kid blues?

1648
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,668
Saxophone players?

1649
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,629
You know, whatever...

1650
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,104
he meant to do...
Coy, you know, mistakes aside, and...

1651
01:52:58,040 --> 01:53:01,667
Nobody deserves to go through life
without seeing their daughter.

1652
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,303
That don't sit well with me.

1653
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:11,184
Then go get them.

1654
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:15,020
- Put it on your desk.
- Thank you.

1655
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,860
- Whoa. What are you doing here? Yeah.
- "Whoa"?

1656
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:21,460
Wanted to see if you were free for dinner.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

1657
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,100
Are you all right?

1658
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,382
- Am I?
- Are you?

1659
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,420
Should I call security?

1660
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,820
- No, Rhus.
- I don't think we need...

1661
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:33,148
This is the one I was telling you about.

1662
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,460
Yeah?

1663
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,460
You know your pals
have Mickey Wolfmann?

1664
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:51,140
What? The FBI? I mean, we suspected,
but we couldn't prove it.

1665
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:52,860
Well, I saw him in their custody.

1666
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,949
- You saw him?
- Yeah.

1667
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,100
Would you be willing
to let me depone you?

1668
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,580
- Sure would.
- You would?

1669
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:01,860
What is it?

1670
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:04,940
You, me, a tape machine,
maybe another DDA to witness it.

1671
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,933
All right,
I need something from you though.

1672
01:54:07,033 --> 01:54:07,820
What?

1673
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,022
I need to look up somebody's jacket.

1674
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:13,580
That's it? That's no big deal.
We do that all the time.

1675
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,670
What, you break into officially
sealed records all the time?

1676
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,228
Grow up. What's the name on the file?

1677
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:22,788
Adrian Prussia.

1678
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:37,700
As if looking for something
he didn't want to find...

1679
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:41,340
it became clear as vodka
you keep in the icebox...

1680
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:46,220
that, whatever the connection between
the L.A.P.D. and Adrian Prussia...

1681
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:49,700
he might as well have been working
for them as a contract killer...

1682
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,551
doing deeds for them
they couldn't do for themselves.

1683
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:58,700
Time after time, he was pulled in,
questioned, arraigned, indicted, no matter.

1684
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,220
Somehow the cases
never quite got to trial...

1685
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:04,902
each being bargained down
in the interest of justice...

1686
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,180
not to mention Adrian,
who invariably walked.

1687
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:11,100
And one of those deeds
appeared to be labeled...

1688
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:15,820
"the justifiable homicide"
of one of the L.A.P.D.'s very own:

1689
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,660
Vincent Indelicato.

1690
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,340
Otherwise known as...

1691
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:21,940
Bigfoot's partner.

1692
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,426
Bigfoot.

1693
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,100
Bigfoot's partner?

1694
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,500
Fucking Bigfoot's partner?

1695
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:31,300
Oh, fuck.

1696
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:36,500
Bigfoot's air of possessed
melancholy now began to make sense.

1697
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,623
This was mourning, all right.

1698
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,260
And it was deep.

1699
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:41,980
This your new partner, Bigfoot?

1700
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,340
Want a banana, Adrian?
Bend over and I'll stick it in for you.

1701
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,300
Fuck you and fuck your banana.

1702
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:49,500
Oh, man, oh, man.

1703
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:54,260
Never be surprised at the levels
of disrespect within the L.A.P.D.

1704
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:58,660
But this was downright nasty,
not to mention unprofessional.

1705
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:02,820
This bond between partners was nearly
the only thing Doc had ever found...

1706
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:05,466
to admire about the L.A.P.D.

1707
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:09,224
You know, there's places
you don't wanna go, Doc.

1708
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:12,144
Go back to the beach.

1709
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:15,107
You smell like a patchouli fart.

1710
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,903
So here's Doc.

1711
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,820
Midnight, pitch-dark...

1712
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:25,700
can't remember whether
they drained the pool or not...

1713
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:28,346
but, hey, what the fuck's it matter?

1714
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:31,540
He bounced once, twice...

1715
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:34,940
and then off the end of the board
in a blind cannonball...

1716
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:38,700
down into old karma
with Adrian Prussia...

1717
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,700
who had not only shot at him once...

1718
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:44,740
but threatened him with a Carl
Yastrzemski Special baseball bat.

1719
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,980
All this leaving Doc to wonder:

1720
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,626
"Where's the partner to watch my back?"

1721
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,624
Far out, man.

1722
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,711
Right.

1723
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,382
Psychedelic.

1724
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:01,500
Done.

1725
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,860
So you're here about...?

1726
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:12,304
Good question.

1727
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:20,267
Wait a minute. This is bullshit.

1728
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:22,226
I remember you.

1729
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:26,300
You're that kid from Fritz's shop
out in Santa Monica, right?

1730
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,547
Yeah.

1731
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:30,820
So, what you up to these days?
Skip tracing?

1732
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:33,182
Or did you go into the priesthood?

1733
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,431
PI.

1734
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:39,587
They gave you a license?

1735
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:42,504
So who sent you here?

1736
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,620
Who are you working for today?

1737
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:47,505
All on spec. All on my own time.

1738
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:51,549
Wrong answer.

1739
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:56,825
How much of your own time
do you think you got left, kid?

1740
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,625
I was just about to ask.

1741
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,660
Howdy, Puck.

1742
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:06,380
Do I know you?

1743
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,700
I don't think I do.

1744
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,460
I don't know, you must remind me
of someone I ran into someplace.

1745
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:13,820
My mistake.

1746
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:17,263
I have a busy day ahead...

1747
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,821
and I know nothing...

1748
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,863
of any of this.

1749
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:32,745
What are you doing here?

1750
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:38,302
I was just... talking to Adrian.

1751
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,305
It's these...

1752
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,900
various cases I'm working on.

1753
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,590
And...

1754
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,983
Glen Charlock...

1755
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:59,626
and... Vincent Indelicato...

1756
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:14,780
and...

1757
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,823
where'd...

1758
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,185
you...

1759
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:22,191
get that...?

1760
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,620
That necklace...

1761
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,740
it looks funny on you.

1762
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,386
Big man, small necklace.

1763
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:36,190
Acid invites you through a door.

1764
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:39,700
PCP opens that door...

1765
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,300
shoves you through it...

1766
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,946
slams the door behind you...

1767
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:45,987
and locks it.

1768
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,787
Special treat for you today, doper.

1769
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,340
Just got it in a shipment...

1770
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,542
of pure Number 4.

1771
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:05,460
Ain't a white guy's finger laid on it...

1772
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:07,981
between the Golden Triangle...

1773
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:12,221
and your own throbbing vein.

1774
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:15,581
Just let me step out here...

1775
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:17,944
and I'll go get you some.

1776
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,864
Don't go away now.

1777
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,665
Puck!

1778
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,385
Pucky!

1779
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,670
Did I hit you?

1780
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,305
Bigfoot?

1781
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,624
What the fuck?

1782
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,700
Did you take care of them okay, Doc?

1783
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:47,220
You fucking lunatic! What is this?

1784
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:49,980
I'm in enough shit personally
with the captain...

1785
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,786
and I've seen you on the range.
Nice work.

1786
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,826
What are you...?

1787
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:00,220
And that there,
is that what I think it is?

1788
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:04,140
There's one of or two of them.
There's more. Enough left for evidence.

1789
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:06,940
Man, Bigfoot, I saw the movie.

1790
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:10,660
As I recall, that character
comes to a bad end.

1791
02:03:10,760 --> 02:03:12,260
Put the gun away, Doc.

1792
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,940
- What?
- The gun. Put it away.

1793
02:03:14,040 --> 02:03:17,220
This is the Golden Fang
you're about to rip off, man.

1794
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:20,500
The fully fucking weird outfit
that kills people.

1795
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:24,100
That's according to your own
delusional system. Get in the car.

1796
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:25,745
Get in the car!

1797
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:49,944
Where are we going?

1798
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:54,463
We had to impound your car again.

1799
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,108
It was parked illegally...

1800
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,783
in front of Adrian's.

1801
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,820
Doper's ESP, Doc.

1802
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:42,591
Doper's ESP.

1803
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:51,300
Oh, no.

1804
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:54,504
Bigfoot, you motherfucker.

1805
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:00,860
Okay, Doc, you have what looks to be
a 20-kilo inconvenience in your trunk.

1806
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,500
And Bigfoot, no doubt,
putting out word to that effect.

1807
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:07,306
And once again, you're the bait.

1808
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:35,020
Hello?

1809
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:37,507
It's sure been a longtime.

1810
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,548
And your name was?

1811
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,983
This is Crocker Fenway.

1812
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:45,548
Japonica's dad?

1813
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,980
What happened this time?

1814
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:54,742
You have something that belongs to some
people I represent, and they'd like it back.

1815
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:59,500
Oh. So you're a principal in all this?

1816
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:02,940
It's only because of me and our small
transaction over Japonica...

1817
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,180
that you're still alive.

1818
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,587
Ever so grateful, sir.

1819
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,420
So, what do we do?

1820
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,780
I suppose someone wants their...

1821
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,301
back?

1822
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:22,031
Why don't we meet this evening at 6:00
at my club, The Portola, in Elysian Park.

1823
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,860
Is there a dress code?

1824
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:28,381
A jacket and tie, if possible.

1825
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,829
I'll see you then.

1826
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:45,783
Mr. Sportello.

1827
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:48,309
Mr. Fenway.

1828
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:05,821
To a peaceful...

1829
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:08,385
resolution.

1830
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:16,985
How's the family?

1831
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:19,144
Japonica's...

1832
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,823
doing fine, if that's what you mean.

1833
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,260
You know...

1834
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:29,545
I think I saw old Japonica
the other day at my doctor's office.

1835
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:34,660
You ever run across a dentist
named Rudy Blatnoyd?

1836
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:38,900
The son of a bitch who until recently
was corrupting my daughter?

1837
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,660
Yes, I do seem to recall the name.

1838
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:45,460
He perished in a trampoline
accident, didn't he?

1839
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:48,425
L.A.P.D. aren't so sure
it was an accident.

1840
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,387
And you'd like to know if I did it?

1841
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,228
What possible motive would I have?

1842
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:00,140
Just because the man preyed on...

1843
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:03,264
an emotionally vulnerable child?

1844
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:06,140
Forced her to engage
in sexual practices...

1845
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:09,700
that might appall
even a sophisticate like yourself?

1846
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:12,540
Does that mean I'd have any reason
to see his miserable...

1847
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:14,460
pedophile career come to an end?

1848
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,745
What a vindictive person
you must imagine me.

1849
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:26,420
I did suspect he was fucking
his receptionist, but what dentist doesn't?

1850
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:29,020
It's some oath they all take
in dentist school.

1851
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:34,780
Anyhow, it's a long way
from strange and weird sex, isn't it?

1852
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:37,100
What about when he forced
my girl to listen...

1853
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:41,385
to original cast albums of Broadway
musicals while he had his way with her?

1854
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:48,501
Or the tastelessness of the decor...

1855
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:52,660
of resort hotel rooms he took her to...

1856
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:56,100
during endodontist conventions.

1857
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:57,745
The wallpaper.

1858
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,868
The lamps.

1859
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,910
Japonica's of legal age now, isn't she?

1860
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:10,145
In a father's eye,
they're always too young.

1861
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,740
To the matter at hand.

1862
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:23,940
Those I represent are prepared to offer you
a generous compensation package...

1863
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:26,871
for the safe return of their property.

1864
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,626
Suppose it didn't have to be
in the form of money.

1865
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:34,101
Well, money would be a lot easier.

1866
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:39,460
There's a saxophone player
named Coy Harlingen.

1867
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:43,980
He's been working undercover for different
anti-subversive outfits, including the L.A.P.D.

1868
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:48,540
And he's come to feel lately
that he made the wrong career choice.

1869
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:50,900
It lost him his family, his freedom.

1870
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,307
And like you, he only has one daughter.

1871
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,420
Please.

1872
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:59,220
Okay. Well, he wants out.

1873
02:09:59,320 --> 02:10:01,820
And I think I can square it
with the heat.

1874
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:05,660
But there's this other bunch,
Vigilant California.

1875
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:08,101
And, well, whoever's running them,
of course...

1876
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,900
My guess is they'd prefer he not disclose
any confidential information.

1877
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,943
Last thing he'd ever do.

1878
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:20,990
Your personal guarantee?

1879
02:10:21,120 --> 02:10:23,507
I'll go after him myself
if he tries anything.

1880
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,549
Then we have a deal.

1881
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:29,940
That's all you wanted?

1882
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:32,302
No money now? Are you sure?

1883
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:39,425
Well, now, how much money would I have to
take from you so I wouldn't lose your respect?

1884
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:44,180
It's a bit late for that, Mr. Sportello.

1885
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:48,704
People like you lose all claim to respect
the first time they pay anybody rent.

1886
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,860
Well, I may not be as well-connected...

1887
02:10:55,960 --> 02:10:59,826
and for sure, not as much
into revenge as you folks are...

1888
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:04,020
but if you're jiving with me, my man...

1889
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:05,220
I say to you:

1890
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:16,545
So where we gonna do this handoff?

1891
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:20,624
Don't know much about history

1892
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:24,345
Don't know much biology

1893
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:28,220
Don't know much about science books

1894
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:31,740
Golden Fang operatives, 12 o'clock.
Fast approaching.

1895
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,271
Look sharp.

1896
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:39,260
And I know that if you love me too

1897
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:42,350
What a wonderful world it would be

1898
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:46,945
Don't know much about geography

1899
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,704
Don't know much trigonometry

1900
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:54,265
All right, you got the keys in here?

1901
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,542
Don't know what a slide rule is for

1902
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:01,751
But I do know, one and one is two

1903
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:05,420
And if this world could be with you

1904
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,624
What a wonderful world this would be

1905
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,709
Now, what's all this?

1906
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:16,420
It's a credit card.
Don't hippies have them?

1907
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:20,100
Yeah, I must've meant that why is
your mother handing me this?

1908
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:23,543
It's not for you.

1909
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:28,740
You're supposed to tell him: "Well done.
Welcome back to the main herd.

1910
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:30,420
Safe journeys."

1911
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:32,180
That's journeys, plural.

1912
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:34,780
"Well done. Welcome back to the herd.
Safe journeys."

1913
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,142
Okay, I guess I can remember that.

1914
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:49,460
What are you looking at?

1915
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:50,866
What?

1916
02:12:57,080 --> 02:13:01,151
So you guys been working
for the Golden Fang long?

1917
02:13:12,160 --> 02:13:13,466
Okay.

1918
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:26,384
Sassy, little girl. Nasty. Mean.

1919
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:37,026
There's nothing? All right.

1920
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:01,700
Everything's cool.

1921
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:05,220
I'm officially off everybody's payroll.
Burke Stodger just called me.

1922
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:06,940
You're a dangerous hombre.

1923
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:08,380
Drive.

1924
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:32,751
You all right?

1925
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:36,429
I'm nervous.

1926
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,306
Yeah.

1927
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:43,268
You know what the Indians say.

1928
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:45,900
You saved my life...

1929
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,940
now you're responsible for it.

1930
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:50,791
No, man. No, that's not true.

1931
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:54,302
Some hippie made that up, man.

1932
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:58,345
You saved your own life, man.
Now you get to live it.

1933
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:55,550
Baby!

1934
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:17,540
Yet there is no avoiding time.

1935
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:19,981
The sea of time.

1936
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:24,500
The sea of memory and forgetfulness.

1937
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:28,980
The years of promise gone
and unrecoverable.

1938
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:33,100
Of the land almost allowed
to claim its better destiny...

1939
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:37,940
only to have that claim jumped
by evildoers known all too well...

1940
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:39,580
and taken instead...

1941
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:44,660
and held hostage to the future
we must live in now, forever.

1942
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,540
So who got her?

1943
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:48,420
Department of Justice.

1944
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:50,820
So, like... justice was served?

1945
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:54,620
That's exactly right, Doc.
That's exactly right.

1946
02:16:54,720 --> 02:17:00,065
May we trust this blessed ship
is bound for some better shore.

1947
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,981
Risen and redeemed.

1948
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:08,904
Where the American fate
mercifully failed to transpire.

1949
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:24,220
Don't get Up.

1950
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:26,627
Bigfoot. Man...

1951
02:17:27,320 --> 02:17:29,582
You smashed down my door?

1952
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:31,346
Come on.

1953
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:35,546
After a long and busy day
of civil rights violations...

1954
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:39,986
I found myself in the neighborhood
and compelled to drop in.

1955
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:45,180
Just to check and see the current state
of affairs of my old stomping grounds.

1956
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:49,060
Seeing as your effort to keep lines
of communication had been...

1957
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:50,460
limited.

1958
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:52,469
To say the least.

1959
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:56,111
Well, I've been busy.

1960
02:17:56,760 --> 02:18:00,706
Trying to figure out which side
of the Zig-Zag paper's the sticky side?

1961
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:05,344
Give it to me.

1962
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:34,820
Listen.

1963
02:18:34,920 --> 02:18:36,940
- I'm sorry about last night.
- I'm sorry about last night

1964
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:38,540
- You?
- You?

1965
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:40,663
Why should you be sorry?

1966
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:44,189
Weird.

1967
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:21,948
Are you okay, brother?

1968
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,502
I'm not your brother.

1969
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,671
No, but you could use a keeper.

1970
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,060
Remember that day?

1971
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:57,628
The Ouija board set us off
into that big storm?

1972
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:03,020
This feels the same way tonight.

1973
02:20:06,040 --> 02:20:07,744
Just us.

1974
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:09,865
Together.

1975
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:18,391
Almost like being underwater.

1976
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:24,109
The world...

1977
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,789
everything...

1978
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:32,661
gone someplace else.

1979
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:40,870
Just figured it was
Sortilège setting us up.

1980
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,180
No.

1981
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:47,220
Her Ouija board and...

1982
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:51,220
She knows things, Doc.

1983
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:56,591
Maybe about us that we don't know.

1984
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:14,985
This don't mean we're back together.

1985
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,424
Of course not.

1986
02:21:25,305 --> 02:21:31,428
