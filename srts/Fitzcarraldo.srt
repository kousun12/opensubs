2
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:20,647
Cayahuari Yacu, the jungle Indians
call this country,

3
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:25,367
"the land where God did not
finish Creation."

4
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,687
They believe only after man
has disappeared

5
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:37,287
will He return to finish His work.

6
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:02,887
For God's sake...

7
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:03,927
If we're gonna
do this...

8
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,087
If we're gonna
do this...

9
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:07,727
...let's do it
in style.

10
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:11,687
We're going to miss Caruso if
you don't put some fire under it.

11
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:19,847
Oh, you've wiped oil all over your face.

12
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:24,167
Isn't that better?

13
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:26,447
Oh, Molly, please.

14
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,447
Come on, for God's sake!

15
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:40,967
Champagne for the horses! The best!

16
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,647
We're gonna make it.

17
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:37,127
Sir, Madam.
This is a gala performance.

18
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:41,967
We come from Iquitos, one thousand
two hundred miles down the Amazon.

19
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,287
I had to row because
our motor broke down.

20
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:45,567
Look at his hands.

21
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:49,847
For two days and two nights I've been
rowing to see Caruso once in my life.

22
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,367
You have no tickets.

23
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:55,887
This man needs to go in there.
He has no ticket but he has a right.

24
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,967
Sir, Madam, you can't go in there.

25
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:02,047
I'm going to build an opera house
in Iquitos and Caruso'll open it.

26
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:06,247
It'll be the greatest opera of the jungle.
Please, let us in.

27
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:10,167
You'll work with us. Let us in, please.

28
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,247
I'd like to be in there myself,
believe me...

29
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:20,487
Follow me!

30
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,487
Make sure to be quiet and press
yourselves right up against the wall.

31
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:16,247
He pointed to you.

32
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:24,407
He pointed to me. You see him...
he means me.

33
00:09:57,487 --> 00:10:01,647
Fitzcarraldo? How do you spell it?

34
00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:04,847
What an interesting name!

35
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:09,207
My father was Irish.
My real name is Fitzgerald.

36
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:11,047
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

37
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:13,047
They had trouble saying it in Peru.

38
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:18,807
Fitzgerald? Lquitos? You're not
the man with the railway are you?

39
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:20,687
Yeah, that's me.

40
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:29,807
Well... the Trans-Andean Railway, but...

41
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:33,287
...the project fell through.

42
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,647
But the idea was a bold one.

43
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:40,647
At the moment I'm trying my luck as
as ice producer, to make money.

44
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:43,447
Here, all people want...

45
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:47,687
...for their money are the
big names from Europe.

46
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:54,407
Sarah Bernhardt, an actress
who can't even sing.

47
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:57,767
But her wooden leg is
the talk of the town.

48
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:03,247
The ice, ah, I mean...

49
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:06,687
I'm doing all this because
I have one dream...

50
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:08,687
...the opera.

51
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,247
The Great Opera in the Jungle!

52
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:16,727
Fitzcarraldo will build it and
Caruso will sing at the premiere.

53
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:20,087
It's only the dreamers
who ever move mountains.

54
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:29,287
For five years now we've been
the richest town in the whole world.

55
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,367
It's like gold fever.

56
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,887
May I show you the house?

57
00:11:37,487 --> 00:11:40,927
When this opera was built
there were only a few huts here.

58
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,247
The building was practically in the jungle.

59
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,727
Prices are ten times higher here
than in New York.

60
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:53,287
There are palaces being built with
tiles from Delft and Florentine marble.

61
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:58,167
And Iquitos is catching up.
It's still a filthy frontier town...

62
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:00,927
...but the rubber business is growing
by leaps and bounds.

63
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,967
The better-off citizens in Manaus,
if I may put it like that...

64
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,727
...send their laundry to Lisbon...

65
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:12,647
...because the water in the Amazon
is felt to be impure.

66
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,407
Aren't you going to stay?

67
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:34,247
I don't know.

68
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:37,047
I don't mind you're running a brothel.

69
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,807
But there are too many of
your clients around.

70
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:44,727
Come on. I train the girls
for the best households.

71
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,847
Much better than sending them
out on the streets.

72
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,407
I've nothing against the girls, Molly.

73
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:55,487
I just can't stand the sight of dandies
who think money can buy everything.

74
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,447
And the opera... I've got to work
on this ice production.

75
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:04,207
You could take a crack at respectability,
you know. Wouldn't kill you.

76
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:07,127
Respectability just made me bankrupt.

77
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:12,527
I'm better off down there by the river.

78
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,807
Got my real audience down there now...

79
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:16,847
The kids?

80
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:20,047
Yeah, that's my public. And a pig.

81
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:25,727
One of those lean racing pigs loves me.

82
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:27,727
How could she help it.

83
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:45,167
When I build my opera house...

84
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:49,207
...I'll see to it you have your own box
and a red velvet armchair.

85
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,647
It works through a chemical reaction
of two different salts.

86
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:43,367
Just imagine the possibilities ice has,
but people don't see it.

87
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:44,927
The children love it.

88
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,767
Yeah, they eat it.

89
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:50,647
Imagine, one day...

90
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,607
...ice in every warehouse,
on every ship.

91
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,887
Yes, make your bet.

92
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:33,607
What do you think of it?

93
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:38,887
I'll tell you what I think. You can
read up about ice in any school book.

94
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:42,207
It's out of the question
to apply for a patent.

95
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,247
But I have the experience,
and it's experience that counts.

96
00:19:46,327 --> 00:19:50,727
What good is ice here?
To cool the rubber?

97
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:54,607
Maybe we should magically
create some glaciers in the jungle.

98
00:19:56,447 --> 00:20:00,207
And then we'll build the Trans-Andean
Railroad on sled skids...

99
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:02,767
...Ioosen the brakes, give her a push...

100
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:06,247
...and adios! Off she goes,
sledding down into the valley?

101
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:10,847
Come on, come on.

102
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,407
Don't take it to heart.

103
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:17,727
Here, this is for you.

104
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,367
Use this, play a hand with us.

105
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:25,087
The precious feeling of losing money!

106
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:29,007
Nothing like it! Ecstasy!

107
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:29,807
The church remains closed 'til
this town has its opera house.

108
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,527
I want the opera house!

109
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,407
I want my opera house!

110
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,167
I want to have an opera!

111
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:48,607
This church remains closed 'til
this town has an opera!

112
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:52,527
I will build my opera!

113
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:08,487
I want to have my opera.

114
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:21,607
I could have let you cool your heels
in there for two weeks.

115
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:26,007
Thanks. Two days were
more than enough.

116
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:31,847
I'm sure Molly is behind this.

117
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:35,607
You're mistaken. But come with me.

118
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:39,087
I'll show you the real reason
I'm letting you out so soon.

119
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:52,727
They won't budge. I felt moved.
Even a horse would be touched.

120
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,967
That shouldn't be too hard to arrange.

121
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,287
All of them together, at the same time?

122
00:24:06,007 --> 00:24:08,007
Don Aquilino, The Borja brothers...

123
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:12,487
I have my ways. Don't worry.
I'll bring all my girls with me.

124
00:24:12,607 --> 00:24:15,767
We'll have all the rubber barons
gathered together like flies.

125
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,647
And I guarantee you,
they'll be feeling good.

126
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,127
I'll bring my phonograph.

127
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,167
You need some sprucing up first.

128
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,607
I'm not letting you out of
my house like that.

129
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:30,167
A steam bath for Mr. Fitzcarraldo!
Full treatment.

130
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:32,927
And then deliver him to my bedroom.

131
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:39,487
This is serious... help...
Hey Molly, tell them... Help!

132
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:51,847
Everyone wants money from me.
The hospital, the fire brigade...

133
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:54,567
...and now you keep talking
my ear off about your opera.

134
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:57,287
It gives expression to
our deepest feelings.

135
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,487
What is he talking about?

136
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:02,927
Our deepest feelings!

137
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:06,247
Just take a look at this.

138
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:08,887
Come a bit closer.

139
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:11,607
Take a good look.

140
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:17,607
A little demonstration.

141
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:24,087
1000 dollar bills seem to taste best.

142
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,767
See how fast our money
goes down the drain?

143
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:33,927
You must have experienced this.

144
00:25:34,007 --> 00:25:37,007
A railway is sure to swallow up
a lot of money.

145
00:25:38,327 --> 00:25:41,447
How thrilling it must be to go bankrupt.

146
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,287
Let's return to our friends.

147
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:48,007
Yes, such a chance to meet all
one's friends and rivals in one place...

148
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:50,647
...does not present itself very often.

149
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,567
Rosita, over there!

150
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:21,007
Take the champagne over there!

151
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:30,247
Please, may we have your attention?

152
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:32,607
Please, come a bit closer.

153
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,727
Servant! Hold him!

154
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,327
He can't get away with this.

155
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:31,207
One moment! Please, please, please!

156
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:35,087
Ladies and gentlemen, don't worry.

157
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:41,447
This man is harmless, he's just had
a soul-stirring experience.

158
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:45,967
My servants will escort you
to the kitchen.

159
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,847
My dogs' cook will prepare you a meal.

160
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:53,807
Thank you very much, sir,
you were superb.

161
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,447
To your dogs' cook.

162
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:03,447
To Verdi.

163
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,167
To Rossini.

164
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:10,967
To Caruso.

165
00:28:11,087 --> 00:28:14,087
To Fitzcarraldo, the
Conquistador of the Useless!

166
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,367
Cheers!

167
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:25,527
As true as I am standing here, one day
I shall bring grand opera to Iquitos.

168
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,087
I will outnumber you.

169
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:32,487
I will outbillion you.

170
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,807
I am the spectacle in the forest.

171
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:36,967
I am the inventor of rubber.

172
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:39,047
I will outrubber you.

173
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:45,447
Sir, the reality of your world
is nothing more...

174
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:48,607
...than a rotten caricature
of great opera.

175
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,727
Fitz, Fitz, let's go.

176
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:55,087
He's as dead as a doornail.
He is no opponent for you.

177
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:59,047
Madam, I'm still standing firm
on both my legs.

178
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,447
You're a big game hunter, aren't you?

179
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:03,607
What's that got to do with it?

180
00:29:03,727 --> 00:29:07,167
Then you should know:
When you shoot an elephant...

181
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:11,087
...he sometimes stays on his legs
for ten days before he topples over.

182
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:15,247
Come on, girls, we're leaving. This way!

183
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:34,927
Rubber. That's the way to do it.
Forget about the ice.

184
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:41,007
You need a big steam-boat.
And most of all you need land.

185
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:42,847
And hundreds of workers.

186
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:48,007
The rubber barons have divided up
the land. But there's still some left.

187
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,447
How do you know?

188
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:52,727
Through Don Aquilino.
Why don't you pay him a visit?

189
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:54,287
Forget about it.

190
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:57,327
Why don't you try him out?

191
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:12,647
My territory begins right here
where the Pongo ends...

192
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:18,287
...and reaches downstream
for 80 miles.

193
00:30:18,807 --> 00:30:20,327
And above the Pongo?

194
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:22,887
I'd like to have that myself.

195
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,527
We've thought about building
a road across the mountains...

196
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:31,247
...but it would be an impossible venture,
and there still wouldn't be...

197
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:35,807
A ship... And nobody
has made it upstream?

198
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:43,407
Want to see for yourself?
We can go a little further by foot.

199
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,327
What's he saying?

200
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:53,527
We must be quiet.

201
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:54,967
He says, whoever talks...

202
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:58,367
...will be swallowed up by
the evil spirits of the rapids.

203
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:38,087
The Indians call the rapids
Chirimagua, "the angry spirits."

204
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:41,807
Anyone who falls in there is lost.

205
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:48,207
The native bare-asses also say,
"The water has no hair to hold on to."

206
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,487
Is this a rubber tree?

207
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:22,167
Right. Hevea brasiliensis.

208
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:36,887
They call the rubber tree caoutchou...

209
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:39,367
..."the tree that weeps."

210
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:42,407
These bare-asses love
flowery language.

211
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:44,847
Gold, they call "sweat of the sun."

212
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:47,767
Bees, "father of honey."

213
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:54,247
You know, it's no easy job
to civilize them, believe me.

214
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,607
How much do you think
this stinky stuff weighs?

215
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:18,567
132 pounds! And I presume you're
familiar with the market price.

216
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:20,847
How long does it take
to make one of them?

217
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,047
Three men one week.

218
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,767
Presently I have a staff of 8,500.

219
00:33:38,287 --> 00:33:42,247
But I am thinking of increasing
to 10,000.

220
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:50,367
You're a strange bird,
but I must say I like you.

221
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:33,807
That's my area. From the Pongo
to the mouth of the Ucayali.

222
00:34:33,887 --> 00:34:38,647
Up there you see the Peruvian Amazon
Company, a joint stock company...

223
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,887
...and there, the Borja brothers.

224
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:42,727
What does that square mean?

225
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:47,847
That's the rubber region of the
Ucayali, about 14 million trees.

226
00:34:48,527 --> 00:34:50,567
It's the only area still unclaimed.

227
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:54,367
Because of the rapids
of the Pongo das Mortes...

228
00:34:54,447 --> 00:34:57,127
...you'd have to have wings
to fly into this area.

229
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,767
What about up on the Pachitea?

230
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:05,967
No rubber trees, maybe a few,
but not enough to make it worthwhile.

231
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:09,127
The only thing you'll find there
are savage Indians.

232
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:13,007
No gold, no rubber, no nothing.

233
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,127
Only head hunters...

234
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,647
The two rivers almost touch each other.

235
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:21,727
What?

236
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:28,967
How exact is this map?
Is there anything more precise?

237
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:31,607
Oh, it's a pretty good map.

238
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:37,687
In 1896 a group of surveyors and
soldiers got to the Upper Pachitea...

239
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,607
...but most of them were murdered.

240
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:44,967
Then some missionaries got as far as
Saramiriza, their farthest settlement.

241
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:49,887
From there on you'll find only
savage Jivaros and Campas.

242
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:55,367
Two padres ended up
as shrunken heads.

243
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,887
Have you ever seen a shrunken head?

244
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:00,207
Yes... I mean...

245
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,007
No... sort of...

246
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:25,207
Have you made your choice?

247
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:28,007
I can't decide... I guess I'll take both.

248
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:31,687
- Molly, listen!
- What is it?

249
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:34,447
I need your money,
every red cent you can spare.

250
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,567
- Oh Fitz, not again...
- I have an idea.

251
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:39,767
An amazing idea!

252
00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:43,087
Here, look at this.

253
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:48,167
I've bought some maps,
I can explain everything to you.

254
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:06,527
First I have to contact a lawyer,
then get a ship.

255
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:09,407
But my money is not gonna
buy you a ship, Fitz.

256
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:25,207
You're squeezing me to death!

257
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:36,127
I can't breathe.

258
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:46,447
The document, please.
Thank you.

259
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:53,287
The act of territorial acquisition
is done step by step.

260
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:56,327
You and your partner sign,
you pay the money...

261
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:59,127
...and I will complete the document
with my signature.

262
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:03,927
Before you sign, I'd like to direct
your attention to the option clause.

263
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:05,767
What option clause?

264
00:38:07,007 --> 00:38:11,687
Through its executive organs, the
Peruvian government is insistent...

265
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:17,087
...with no exceptions, that a region of
this size be taken into possession...

266
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,807
...by deed and by proof
within nine months.

267
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:23,567
You will have to prove that real
operational steps...

268
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:26,207
...have been taken
to exploit the region.

269
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:29,847
Otherwise your right of exploitation
will be terminated.

270
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:33,807
The point is that the state is
concerned that areas such as this...

271
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:37,287
...are productively used by
competent men of business...

272
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:38,327
...so that they...

273
00:38:38,447 --> 00:38:40,727
Come on, we are wasting time.

274
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:44,327
May I ask you a question
of a personal nature?

275
00:38:45,727 --> 00:38:48,447
Do you really know what you're doing?

276
00:38:49,887 --> 00:38:51,647
We're gonna do what
nobody's ever done.

277
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:54,887
We're going to be very, very rich.

278
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:58,887
Well?

279
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:05,447
Please, sir, sign on the dotted line.

280
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,647
That's it.

281
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:28,047
That's it.

282
00:39:28,727 --> 00:39:30,527
Isn't it marvelous?

283
00:39:31,087 --> 00:39:33,407
We should be able to fix it up.

284
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,807
It's wonderful.

285
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:45,847
You haven't seen the whole thing.

286
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,607
I like it already.

287
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:51,007
Watch out here.

288
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:52,847
Everything's rotted.

289
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,487
The engine room.

290
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,287
Up the stairs.

291
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,127
Wait a moment.

292
00:40:16,127 --> 00:40:17,567
Wait. Let me go first.

293
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:34,087
To our contract!
Please come in, gentlemen.

294
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:49,807
Now that the purchase of my ship
is settled, let me be quite frank.

295
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:51,047
You bet.

296
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:55,927
I forced you to take Cholo as mechanic
or you wouldn't have gotten the ship.

297
00:40:58,367 --> 00:40:59,847
I realize that.

298
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,727
Very good. Good.

299
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:06,847
He's a first-rate mechanic,
I'll tell you that much.

300
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:12,207
Now, what else is he?

301
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:15,687
The reason behind it all,
excuse my bluntness...

302
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:20,087
...is that I wish to be kept informed
about the activities of my competitors.

303
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:24,487
I don't want my territory contested.

304
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:26,607
Don't worry.

305
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:30,047
Every steamship owner
is a potential enemy...

306
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:33,927
...but those with just a canoe
can't hurt us.

307
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:38,527
The two of us have a bet going...

308
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:41,167
...how long it will take
until you go bankrupt.

309
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:44,007
Oh, don't take it personally, please.

310
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,687
We're all sportsmen, aren't we?

311
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:49,967
No, only one of us.

312
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,727
I shall move a mountain.

313
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:35,567
When is she gonna be ready?

314
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:41,607
Tomorrow. For days he's been
telling me tomorrow.

315
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:43,687
I hope she'll be ready for launching.

316
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,727
I wonder what this
character's really up to.

317
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:35,447
What's your name?

318
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,327
Paul Resenbrink. I'm Dutch.

319
00:43:39,247 --> 00:43:41,127
They call me Orinoco Paul...

320
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:44,807
...because I know every goddamn
bend in this river.

321
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:49,607
You haven't sailed for some time.

322
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:53,167
That's right.
My last ship was the Adolfo.

323
00:43:53,327 --> 00:43:56,767
My eyesight isn't so good,
but I cannot be fooled.

324
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,287
What do you mean?

325
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:02,007
The jungle plays tricks on your senses.

326
00:44:02,127 --> 00:44:05,447
It's full of lies, demons, illusions.

327
00:44:05,927 --> 00:44:10,967
I have learned to tell the difference
between reality and hallucinations.

328
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:16,967
I see that you took part in
the Pachitea expedition in 1886.

329
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:18,647
Yes, as helmsman.

330
00:44:18,927 --> 00:44:21,247
On the return trip I was the captain.

331
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:25,727
The captain died.
There were only five survivors.

332
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:32,167
Paul Resenbrink, you have
captain's authority.

333
00:44:32,247 --> 00:44:34,247
Help me choose the crew.

334
00:44:35,567 --> 00:44:38,087
We need strong, fearless men.

335
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:41,407
I'm afraid we'll find few good men here.

336
00:44:41,527 --> 00:44:43,527
First of all we need a pilot.

337
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,167
Does anyone have
experience as a pilot?

338
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:59,327
Scram, you puny runt!
I'm Huerequeque.

339
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:09,567
Brethren! I am Huerequeque!

340
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,527
I am the best cook in all of
el Amazonas.

341
00:45:12,687 --> 00:45:15,967
I have been on every ship.

342
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:21,927
And amigo, I'm not stupid.
I know what your plans are.

343
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:25,647
Huerequeque may tip the bottle
now and then...

344
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:31,047
...but up here... electric, electrico!

345
00:45:34,127 --> 00:45:39,607
Also, I am the best gunman
on the entire Amazon.

346
00:45:39,727 --> 00:45:43,007
- What do you think of him?
- Upstream and downstream.

347
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:45,967
- Is he really a good gunman?
- I would have to say, yes.

348
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,567
What was your name? Huere...

349
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:50,087
Huerequeque.

350
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:56,447
Huerequeque, you are our cook.

351
00:45:56,727 --> 00:45:58,607
Cheers, then.

352
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:05,927
Please understand.

353
00:46:06,047 --> 00:46:09,487
Who bought the ship?
Who paid for the crew?

354
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:11,207
It's my right to come with you.

355
00:46:11,287 --> 00:46:15,607
Molly, you can't leave the girls.
What are they gonna do without you?

356
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:17,807
And what will I do without you?

357
00:46:17,927 --> 00:46:19,527
I'll be back.

358
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:24,567
Fitz... do you still love me?

359
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:28,047
We are partners, you and me.

360
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:26,167
Oh Fitz, you're crazy!

361
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:18,167
Oh Fitz, it's wonderful!

362
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:20,167
This is your day, Molly!

363
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:30,807
You've given the ship my name!

364
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:34,127
That's more than my poor
heart can stand.

365
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,087
Now comes the official part.

366
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:39,887
Here. Throw it... hard!

367
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:04,167
I don't want those señoritas
on board my ship.

368
00:49:04,287 --> 00:49:08,047
These are my assistants.
I can't cook without them.

369
00:49:08,127 --> 00:49:10,207
Come on, kids, come on.

370
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,327
Why isn't he going down to the Ucayali?

371
00:49:59,327 --> 00:50:01,287
Why is he heading upstream?

372
00:50:01,407 --> 00:50:03,727
I thought he was going
to the Pongo das Mortes.

373
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:05,127
You saw right.

374
00:50:05,247 --> 00:50:08,407
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald
is going up the Amazon.

375
00:50:57,807 --> 00:51:00,807
We're going upstream!
What's the idea?

376
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:04,247
We're going up the river.
That's the idea.

377
00:51:04,807 --> 00:51:08,727
And, from now on, you only
leave the engine room if I say so.

378
00:52:31,007 --> 00:52:35,047
What do you think you're doing?
Getting around my girls!

379
00:52:35,127 --> 00:52:36,527
Get lost!

380
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:54,447
Don Fitzcarraldo! Don Fitzcarraldo!

381
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:59,967
You're back at last.
I'd almost given up hope.

382
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:03,967
Look here, Amazon Terminal
ready for action.

383
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:06,007
I see you've become a father.

384
00:54:06,487 --> 00:54:09,127
I knew you'd come back.

385
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:13,487
I thought you'd forgotten about me
when the railroad construction ceased.

386
00:54:13,847 --> 00:54:17,327
Every year I repaint
the first class booking office.

387
00:54:17,607 --> 00:54:19,207
It looks a little weather-beaten...

388
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:22,527
...but wait until your trains cross
the mountains from the Amazon...

389
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,647
...to the Pacific,
then everything will change.

390
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:29,047
I've been here six years now,
without payment.

391
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:30,167
Therefore...

392
00:54:30,687 --> 00:54:32,767
The engine is in good working order.

393
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:35,207
All the levers work, but...

394
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:37,687
But I must confess...

395
00:54:37,807 --> 00:54:42,847
...I was forced to sell a few iron parts
to the Indians.

396
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:47,527
They need it for their
machetes and things.

397
00:54:47,647 --> 00:54:50,727
They used to come at night
to steal parts.

398
00:54:50,847 --> 00:54:52,687
So I thought...

399
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:58,487
...it was better to sell than
to have things stolen at night.

400
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:03,847
I had to do it. I was left alone
and deserted on this post.

401
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,767
I thought you'd been sent home
like everybody else.

402
00:55:08,527 --> 00:55:10,727
Let me show you outside.

403
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,927
The tracks reach 200 meters
deep into the jungle.

404
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,207
Come with me. I made an
invention to scare off the Indians.

405
00:55:21,367 --> 00:55:24,647
They've become more cautious.
I do the same thing with the snakes.

406
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:26,847
I connect an electric line to the tracks.

407
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:33,607
The Indians get their fingers singed.
They won't touch them again.

408
00:55:34,487 --> 00:55:39,127
I chase the snakes onto the rails
with a stick.

409
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:43,767
On the first rail they get fried,
on the second they turn to ash.

410
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,847
Every year, I cut back the bushes...

411
00:55:48,527 --> 00:55:50,727
When will you resume construction?

412
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:56,767
The thing is... we've come here
on a different project.

413
00:55:58,087 --> 00:56:01,887
Our whole financial situation will
change overnight, if it works.

414
00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:05,727
What I'm trying to say is...

415
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:10,047
...we need the tracks
for another purpose.

416
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:25,687
No, not those from under the engine,
not those...

417
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:34,767
Don Fitzcarraldo.

418
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:42,447
The men are removing
the tracks under the locomotive.

419
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:45,967
I'm begging you, leave me just
a few yards to roll it back and forth.

420
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,927
Hey, leave those under there!
There's more out in the forest.

421
00:56:51,487 --> 00:56:54,487
Thank you, thank you.

422
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:25,007
We should have reached
the Pachitea a long time ago.

423
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:27,287
No, we haven't.

424
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:29,847
But according to the map...

425
00:57:30,287 --> 00:57:32,327
I don't rely on maps.

426
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:35,807
How can you be so sure about that?

427
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:52,607
No river tastes like the Pachitea.
It's just ahead of us.

428
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:55,127
Isn't that something...

429
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:14,087
Brimming over!

430
00:58:19,087 --> 00:58:20,967
Oh, these women!

431
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,687
That's what I need.

432
00:59:11,407 --> 00:59:12,807
What's going on here?

433
00:59:13,327 --> 00:59:15,727
We're going up the Pachitea.

434
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:19,927
Is that so?

435
00:59:52,687 --> 00:59:54,647
Where are we going?

436
00:59:54,927 --> 00:59:58,007
Amigos, welcome to the Pachitea!

437
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:01,207
Known for it's native hospitality...

438
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:30,007
Something is going on down below.

439
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:33,127
They don't seem to agree
with our course.

440
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,807
What?

441
01:00:59,527 --> 01:01:04,287
I told you in Iquitos I needed men,
not cowards who shit in their pants.

442
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:09,527
So...

443
01:01:11,287 --> 01:01:13,567
Whoever wants to leave, step forward.

444
01:01:54,887 --> 01:01:57,447
Welcome to Saramiriza!

445
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:02,927
Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald.

446
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:07,207
We thought you were
a government commission.

447
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:09,407
Welcome to our place, here.

448
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:11,447
Welcome.

449
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:14,007
Happy to have you.

450
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:16,607
- I am Huerequeque.
- Welcome.

451
01:02:34,007 --> 01:02:35,967
Thank you, thanks.

452
01:02:38,767 --> 01:02:41,927
How can anyone learn patriotism
from a school book?

453
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:43,727
The Government requires it.

454
01:02:44,087 --> 01:02:47,567
The natives get used to it
like vaccination.

455
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:50,567
The children already feel like Peruvians.

456
01:02:50,727 --> 01:02:52,527
The other day I asked them...

457
01:02:52,807 --> 01:02:54,087
..."Are you Indians?"

458
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,367
"No," they said, "not us,
the ones up the river are."

459
01:02:58,447 --> 01:03:00,967
Then I asked, "What are Indians?"

460
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:03,367
They said, "Indians are people...

461
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:06,807
...who can't read and who don't know
how to wash their clothes."

462
01:03:06,927 --> 01:03:08,967
And what do the older people say?

463
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,287
Well.

464
01:03:10,647 --> 01:03:14,407
We can't seem to cure them
of the idea...

465
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:17,647
...that our everyday life
is only an illusion...

466
01:03:17,767 --> 01:03:21,207
...behind which lies
the reality of dreams.

467
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:25,727
I am very interested in these ideas.

468
01:03:26,047 --> 01:03:28,167
I specialize in opera myself.

469
01:03:30,247 --> 01:03:33,647
What do you know about the
Jivaros on the upper Pachitea?

470
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:37,007
I was there during the disaster in '96.

471
01:03:37,127 --> 01:03:39,207
Have you had any contact since then?

472
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:43,447
Some years ago, two of our brothers
set off with some natives.

473
01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:45,807
One of them came back
a few days later...

474
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:49,447
...and said the Jivaros had
withdrawn deep into the forest.

475
01:03:49,527 --> 01:03:52,007
The expedition
vanished without a trace.

476
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:55,847
A few weeks later, one of our
brothers was washed up.

477
01:03:55,927 --> 01:03:59,367
They'd filled his stomach with
heavy stones and his head was gone.

478
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:03,727
Anyway, what do you want up there?

479
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:08,567
I'm planning something geographical.

480
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:12,087
Paul.

481
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:17,327
The crew.

482
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:25,367
Quiet down, you drunken idiots!
Stop it!

483
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:51,687
You have to crack down on the men,
or you can find yourself a new captain.

484
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:54,847
Who's causing trouble?

485
01:04:55,727 --> 01:04:59,927
Evaristo Chavez and Fabiano,
the Brazilian. And the two women.

486
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:04,007
They must go ashore immediately,
they're the main ones.

487
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:08,167
And Huerequeque, he's smart
but not to be trusted.

488
01:05:15,647 --> 01:05:20,527
Your services are no longer required.
I give you two minutes to get ashore.

489
01:05:20,647 --> 01:05:23,687
You'll see, we're the lucky ones.

490
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:28,327
And the women.

491
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:30,807
Come on, move!

492
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:35,367
See to the rest!

493
01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:40,167
And all of you, back to work. Go on!

494
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:13,207
Reduce speed! Half speed ahead!

495
01:09:19,567 --> 01:09:21,327
What are the men doing?

496
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:32,767
They've armed themselves.

497
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:36,367
Under no circumstances
are they to shoot.

498
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,567
That was our mistake
on the first expedition.

499
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:45,767
Go down and tell them that,
or there'll be a disaster.

500
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:14,007
What the hell are you doing?

501
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:18,127
Just trying to have a little
conversation with our invisible friends.

502
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:21,447
Idiot, this will cost us our lives.
Yours first.

503
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:21,927
There are silences and silences.

504
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:25,447
And this one, I don't like at all.

505
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:35,687
There's something on the water.

506
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:39,527
Where?

507
01:11:40,207 --> 01:11:43,167
Something black, floating towards us.

508
01:12:28,967 --> 01:12:31,087
What's an umbrella doing here?

509
01:12:31,207 --> 01:12:35,487
It must have belonged to one of the
missionaries that the Jivaros killed.

510
01:12:39,847 --> 01:12:41,287
Strange.

511
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:49,447
Seems to be a last warning.
The bare-asses love flowery gestures.

512
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:52,207
I wish they would show themselves.

513
01:13:09,367 --> 01:13:11,367
Now it's Caruso's turn.

514
01:14:42,967 --> 01:14:45,327
Do you see the Indians in the canoe?

515
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:47,847
Could that be a trap?

516
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:52,927
It doesn't look like one.
No, I don't think so.

517
01:14:53,847 --> 01:14:58,487
They would attack at night.
And in bigger groups.

518
01:15:02,047 --> 01:15:04,607
Shall we stop and try to make contact?

519
01:15:04,687 --> 01:15:08,967
No, don't stop.
They wouldn't talk to us anyway.

520
01:15:33,767 --> 01:15:35,487
Something's moving over there.

521
01:15:38,207 --> 01:15:42,927
Those bare-asses have never seen the
likes of this. Teach 'em some respect.

522
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:20,607
Everything depends on
how we behave.

523
01:16:25,807 --> 01:16:28,287
Tell me everything
you know about them.

524
01:16:29,967 --> 01:16:34,847
These Jivaro probably left the
interior of Brazil about 300 years ago.

525
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:38,247
For ten generations they've been
criss-crossing the jungle...

526
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:42,007
...in search of a white God
in a divine vessel.

527
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:47,207
At the end of their pilgrimage
he would show them...

528
01:16:47,327 --> 01:16:50,887
...a land without sorrow and death.

529
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:54,327
We're gonna take advantage
of this myth.

530
01:17:06,527 --> 01:17:08,687
What the hell has that
got to do with us?

531
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:13,407
If a bare-ass comes too close,
I'll put a bullet right between his eyes.

532
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:16,007
But this God doesn't
come with canons.

533
01:17:17,887 --> 01:17:20,167
He comes with the voice of Caruso.

534
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:15,967
Your loyal crew has deserted you.

535
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:18,447
That finishes this journey.

536
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:33,607
Why didn't you go with them?

537
01:18:33,687 --> 01:18:37,207
Because I want this whole
damned ship to turn back.

538
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:42,687
Don't mess with me.
I'll do what I like around here.

539
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:48,687
Just keep the engine running.

540
01:19:03,487 --> 01:19:04,807
Those bastards!

541
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:11,207
Suddenly they were all there
with their rifles.

542
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:19,207
I told you all along they were no good.
They'll never make it out of here.

543
01:19:19,327 --> 01:19:21,927
There's only three of us left.
You, me and Cholo.

544
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,287
What, him?

545
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:28,687
Now we really need some Italian opera.

546
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:30,567
Don't you agree?

547
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:18,247
That's the end of it.
The dream is over.

548
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,647
Can you turn here?

549
01:21:28,727 --> 01:21:31,407
A bit narrow, but it'll work.

550
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:45,407
It won't work.

551
01:21:48,407 --> 01:21:50,007
Did you say something?

552
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:52,567
Turn around.

553
01:21:55,407 --> 01:21:57,087
Do you see what I see?

554
01:21:58,527 --> 01:22:00,807
Just what we needed.

555
01:22:01,407 --> 01:22:04,087
Breaking through there
would be the end of us.

556
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:07,767
There's just one way to go...
straight ahead.

557
01:22:09,847 --> 01:22:12,767
You better pull ashore.

558
01:22:14,207 --> 01:22:17,327
Go down to the engine room,
very casually.

559
01:22:23,087 --> 01:22:27,087
They're armed...
with bows and arrows.

560
01:22:28,647 --> 01:22:31,687
But they're keeping their distance.
Ever seen this before?

561
01:22:32,207 --> 01:22:33,887
No, never.

562
01:22:42,247 --> 01:22:45,927
Damn it, now they are
blocking the way.

563
01:23:19,887 --> 01:23:21,607
Are they still there?

564
01:23:21,807 --> 01:23:26,567
Even more of them now.
Maybe a hundred canoes.

565
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:29,487
Give me a shout when the fun begins.

566
01:23:29,607 --> 01:23:33,087
I wanna brighten up my last hour
with a little fireworks.

567
01:24:08,407 --> 01:24:11,167
Brethren, what time is it, anyway?

568
01:24:11,327 --> 01:24:15,687
Over here, bare-asses,
I'll pour you a beer.

569
01:24:15,807 --> 01:24:18,767
Hurry up, I'll buy you a drink.

570
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,127
Where did you come from?

571
01:24:20,207 --> 01:24:23,767
I just had a nap. Have the others quit?

572
01:24:28,087 --> 01:24:29,407
Shut up!

573
01:29:13,847 --> 01:29:15,407
What do they say?

574
01:29:15,527 --> 01:29:17,407
They're talking about our ship...

575
01:29:17,527 --> 01:29:22,767
...the "white vessel" from which
they expect the promised salvation.

576
01:29:22,847 --> 01:29:27,167
They say there's a curse
weighing on the entire land.

577
01:29:28,327 --> 01:29:32,487
They know that we are not gods,
but the ship has really impressed them.

578
01:29:32,607 --> 01:29:36,327
But why do they play the flute?
What is happening?

579
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:51,887
My friends, I think we will continue.

580
01:30:47,927 --> 01:30:50,367
See the red cliff on the right hand side?

581
01:30:50,447 --> 01:30:51,807
Yes, I see it.

582
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:54,127
That must be it.

583
01:30:54,767 --> 01:30:59,847
Good. We can't go much further,
or we'll run onto a sandbank.

584
01:31:01,327 --> 01:31:03,527
That slope may look insignificant...

585
01:31:03,887 --> 01:31:05,807
...but it's gonna be my destiny.

586
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:26,047
Come on, follow me!

587
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:33,127
Now he's showing his cards.

588
01:31:57,567 --> 01:31:59,047
This is it.

589
01:32:03,887 --> 01:32:05,727
This is what we were looking for.

590
01:32:06,407 --> 01:32:08,887
Here? This?

591
01:32:09,807 --> 01:32:15,447
Do we have to climb a tree
for you dimwits to understand?

592
01:32:15,527 --> 01:32:19,007
We'll build a nice platform
for the gentlemen. Up there.

593
01:32:42,447 --> 01:32:44,687
I can hardly believe it.

594
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:48,167
There. There's the Ucayali.

595
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:53,287
All the river above the
Pongo das Mortes belongs to us.

596
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:57,087
I know, I know.
We'll make a railway tunnel.

597
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:58,207
No.

598
01:32:59,567 --> 01:33:02,207
We're going to drag that
ship over the mountain.

599
01:33:02,407 --> 01:33:04,807
And the bare-asses
are going to help us.

600
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:07,407
How the hell are we going to do that?

601
01:33:07,527 --> 01:33:09,927
Just like the cow jumped
over the moon.

602
01:33:10,447 --> 01:33:12,207
I like this.

603
01:33:15,647 --> 01:33:16,927
Count me in.

604
01:33:26,847 --> 01:33:27,847
Come in.

605
01:33:33,727 --> 01:33:34,807
What is it?

606
01:33:34,927 --> 01:33:37,647
I still don't understand
what you've got in mind.

607
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:40,687
Come in. I'll show you.

608
01:33:48,407 --> 01:33:49,607
This...

609
01:33:50,887 --> 01:33:52,927
...is the Amazon.

610
01:33:54,447 --> 01:33:55,927
Here is Iquitos.

611
01:33:57,447 --> 01:33:58,847
This...

612
01:34:00,687 --> 01:34:03,167
...is the Ucayali.

613
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:06,207
Right?

614
01:34:07,287 --> 01:34:08,487
And here...

615
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:14,567
...this is the Pachitea.

616
01:34:17,287 --> 01:34:22,527
So, first we went up the Amazon...

617
01:34:23,767 --> 01:34:26,327
...and then up the Pachitea.

618
01:34:26,447 --> 01:34:28,487
We are here right now...

619
01:34:29,527 --> 01:34:33,847
...and we'll drag the ship
over this mountain.

620
01:34:34,367 --> 01:34:35,527
Exactly there.

621
01:34:38,207 --> 01:34:42,247
From here to here
we'll operate the ship...

622
01:34:42,327 --> 01:34:45,727
...to collect rubber from
thousands of workers.

623
01:34:45,807 --> 01:34:48,487
Why didn't we move up the Ucayali?

624
01:34:49,127 --> 01:34:51,527
Because of the Pongo das Mortes.

625
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:55,567
Nobody will ever make it
through those rapids.

626
01:34:55,687 --> 01:35:00,207
Yes, but how do you get the rubber
to Iquitos? We need another ship.

627
01:35:00,527 --> 01:35:04,767
We'll carry it back over the mountain
and build a settlement there.

628
01:35:04,847 --> 01:35:10,167
Soon we'll be so rich we'll have all
the ships we need to take it to Iquitos.

629
01:35:12,767 --> 01:35:15,727
- I've explained our project to the Chief.
- What's his answer?

630
01:35:15,847 --> 01:35:17,367
He just says yes.

631
01:37:39,607 --> 01:37:40,967
More to the left.

632
01:37:42,487 --> 01:37:43,607
A little more.

633
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:45,087
Stop!

634
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:47,567
Again, a bit more to the left.

635
01:37:49,527 --> 01:37:50,647
A little more.

636
01:37:51,367 --> 01:37:52,367
Stop!

637
01:37:54,127 --> 01:37:55,607
Yes, yes!

638
01:37:59,887 --> 01:38:03,407
T-square at 42 degrees.

639
01:38:36,047 --> 01:38:37,767
Not a bad start, was it?

640
01:38:37,887 --> 01:38:38,847
Right.

641
01:38:40,887 --> 01:38:44,327
There are even children here.
It's a good sign.

642
01:38:55,607 --> 01:38:56,967
What do you think, Paul...

643
01:38:57,087 --> 01:38:59,607
...will the Indians stick with us?

644
01:38:59,687 --> 01:39:01,927
You can't tell what they really think.

645
01:39:02,007 --> 01:39:05,607
But how the hell are we gonna
get that ship over the hill?

646
01:39:07,327 --> 01:39:11,287
If nothing else works,
then we'll make a tunnel.

647
01:39:12,047 --> 01:39:13,687
I could even do it alone...

648
01:39:14,447 --> 01:39:16,607
...if we had a perfect pulley system.

649
01:39:19,047 --> 01:39:22,447
But I would need ten miles of rope
and it would take me ten weeks...

650
01:39:22,567 --> 01:39:24,527
...to pull the ship ten inches.

651
01:39:24,647 --> 01:39:27,207
Unfortunately, we haven't
got that much time.

652
01:39:27,367 --> 01:39:30,407
We have seven more months
before the option runs out.

653
01:39:30,687 --> 01:39:34,167
We have a winch and the
strength of hundreds of Indians.

654
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:37,167
We are going to drag this ship
over the mountain.

655
01:40:09,047 --> 01:40:10,807
Who are your little friends?

656
01:40:11,687 --> 01:40:14,647
McNamara, he's my footman.

657
01:40:14,727 --> 01:40:17,167
And this is el comandante.

658
01:40:17,487 --> 01:40:20,567
Here's to you, McNamara.

659
01:41:12,087 --> 01:41:14,687
This is much steeper than we thought.

660
01:41:16,407 --> 01:41:18,247
Now, with the trees cut down...

661
01:41:19,687 --> 01:41:21,927
...you can really see how steep it is.

662
01:41:23,127 --> 01:41:26,767
We have to level the ground,
build a ramp.

663
01:41:28,167 --> 01:41:33,127
And up there we'll have to make
a cut through to the top.

664
01:41:33,647 --> 01:41:35,767
That could take months.

665
01:41:35,887 --> 01:41:37,047
Dynamite!

666
01:41:37,247 --> 01:41:39,167
I hope we have enough dynamite.

667
01:41:39,287 --> 01:41:41,447
Careful, that'll frighten the bare-asses.

668
01:41:42,327 --> 01:41:44,047
We have no choice.

669
01:42:41,167 --> 01:42:43,407
Take cover! Get back!

670
01:42:43,527 --> 01:42:45,727
Watch out! Danger!

671
01:42:52,327 --> 01:42:55,727
Hold it, hold it! Where are you going?

672
01:42:56,687 --> 01:42:59,767
Now go back to work, come on.

673
01:45:25,927 --> 01:45:28,527
Those logs up there.
Huerequeque, come here.

674
01:45:33,487 --> 01:45:37,287
How can this trunk withstand
the pull of hundreds of tons?

675
01:45:37,367 --> 01:45:41,447
It will. See how deep we have
anchored it in the ground.

676
01:45:42,887 --> 01:45:44,327
As tough as iron.

677
01:45:45,607 --> 01:45:47,007
Bring it down here!

678
01:46:05,807 --> 01:46:07,287
Huerequeque, come with me.

679
01:48:18,607 --> 01:48:19,767
Go on.

680
01:48:22,167 --> 01:48:23,327
Slowly.

681
01:48:24,487 --> 01:48:26,647
If we had known that you planned...

682
01:48:26,727 --> 01:48:30,207
...to move the boat on railway tracks...

683
01:48:30,727 --> 01:48:33,447
...I could have told you to
leave the tracks right there...

684
01:48:33,527 --> 01:48:35,447
...back at your Amazon station.

685
01:48:44,007 --> 01:48:46,447
Sorry I can't help you.

686
01:48:46,727 --> 01:48:49,127
I had a bit too much to drink yesterday.

687
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:13,447
Shouldn't we tell him that it
melts away to nothing?

688
01:49:13,527 --> 01:49:16,607
Doesn't work. There's no
word for ice in their language.

689
01:49:58,887 --> 01:50:00,407
Come on, get out of there!

690
01:50:00,487 --> 01:50:01,807
Out! Out!

691
01:50:04,007 --> 01:50:05,727
Give it a go!

692
01:51:07,047 --> 01:51:08,487
Give it all you got!

693
01:51:14,367 --> 01:51:16,287
I'll be damned...
It's working.

694
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:18,327
It's moving.

695
01:51:19,087 --> 01:51:21,287
- It's moving!
- It's moving!

696
01:51:32,647 --> 01:51:33,847
Watch out!

697
01:54:11,047 --> 01:54:14,367
They've been staring at the river for
two days and two nights now.

698
01:54:15,087 --> 01:54:17,607
I'm sure it's because of
the terrible accident.

699
01:54:17,767 --> 01:54:20,327
I can't get anything out of them.

700
01:54:39,807 --> 01:54:40,767
And?

701
01:54:41,687 --> 01:54:42,767
They're gone.

702
01:54:42,887 --> 01:54:46,407
All of them?
They've really disappeared?

703
01:54:46,807 --> 01:54:48,647
What do you make of this?

704
01:54:49,127 --> 01:54:52,087
I had this strange feeling,
so I went outside.

705
01:54:52,447 --> 01:54:56,407
Not a soul, nothing.
They've all disappeared.

706
01:54:56,567 --> 01:54:58,287
That can mean anything.

707
01:54:58,407 --> 01:55:01,647
It could mean that they'll attack us.

708
01:55:02,047 --> 01:55:05,807
But the boy is still here.
My footman, McNamara.

709
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:09,287
For that he'll be made Chief one day.

710
01:56:00,327 --> 01:56:03,727
They're back as if they'd
never been gone.

711
01:56:07,647 --> 01:56:10,487
Don't ask me for an explanation.

712
01:56:30,167 --> 01:56:33,287
I can't believe this crazy thing
Huerequeque has thought up.

713
01:56:34,567 --> 01:56:39,527
Amigos, the engine is running.
Now that's what I call brainwork.

714
01:56:39,607 --> 01:56:40,687
All you do is drink!

715
01:56:40,807 --> 01:56:45,367
We could start up the engine and
drive the anchor winch off of it.

716
01:56:45,447 --> 01:56:50,327
That way the ship will pull itself up
the mountain under it's own steam.

717
01:58:35,047 --> 01:58:36,447
Now, what do you say to that?

718
01:58:36,567 --> 01:58:39,207
There are times when a peasant's
brain is good for something.

719
01:58:39,327 --> 01:58:40,887
You ain't no peasant!

720
01:58:40,967 --> 01:58:44,047
You're the finest drunkard ever
to stagger over this earth.

721
01:58:44,327 --> 01:58:46,127
- But we forgot something.
- What?

722
01:58:46,207 --> 01:58:48,847
Enrico! Enrico Caruso!

723
02:00:34,007 --> 02:00:35,647
Why are they doing all this?

724
02:00:37,567 --> 02:00:40,167
Why are they working like dogs for us?

725
02:00:42,407 --> 02:00:43,327
Why?

726
02:00:44,927 --> 02:00:46,567
Why? Why?

727
02:00:47,647 --> 02:00:48,967
Why?

728
02:00:51,007 --> 02:00:54,847
- Why?
- No, I don't know either.

729
02:00:55,287 --> 02:00:58,807
The only thing I know is that
there must be a reason for it.

730
02:00:58,887 --> 02:01:02,367
They're planning something, I bet.

731
02:01:15,647 --> 02:01:17,327
You must drink it.

732
02:01:17,607 --> 02:01:20,327
It is yucca.
Yucca with fermented saliva.

733
02:01:20,447 --> 02:01:21,847
Go on, drink!

734
02:01:21,927 --> 02:01:25,687
My God, time is flying
and we are getting nowhere.

735
02:03:58,407 --> 02:03:59,887
Something's up.

736
02:04:00,007 --> 02:04:03,727
The men are preparing barbasco,
a very strong poison.

737
02:04:03,847 --> 02:04:06,487
And they are painted black.

738
02:04:08,447 --> 02:04:12,007
But most of the men have hidden in the
woods and have armed themselves.

739
02:04:24,807 --> 02:04:26,247
What does that mean?

740
02:04:26,367 --> 02:04:29,767
As far as I know, the paint is
supposed to make them invisible.

741
02:04:29,887 --> 02:04:35,047
They only do that when they go
hunting or when they go to war.

742
02:04:37,607 --> 02:04:40,407
Let's return to the ship,
load our rifles.

743
02:04:40,487 --> 02:04:42,727
We wouldn't stand a chance.

744
02:04:59,607 --> 02:05:02,527
It seems to me that they
are planning something.

745
02:05:02,607 --> 02:05:08,327
And I fear that we four will soon
end up as shrunken heads.

746
02:05:09,567 --> 02:05:11,807
I think we're safe for the moment.

747
02:05:12,287 --> 02:05:13,927
How do you know?

748
02:05:14,367 --> 02:05:16,447
There is a sign.

749
02:05:17,447 --> 02:05:18,367
Look...

750
02:05:19,527 --> 02:05:21,567
See those hands on the railing?

751
02:14:55,447 --> 02:14:56,727
What has happened?

752
02:14:58,327 --> 02:15:02,327
The Pongo! We're drifting into
the Pongo! Cholo!

753
02:15:14,287 --> 02:15:15,287
Cholo!

754
02:15:16,087 --> 02:15:18,527
Paul! Cholo!

755
02:15:18,647 --> 02:15:20,447
I must stop the ship!

756
02:15:27,887 --> 02:15:31,047
Start the fire!
We're drifting into the Pongo!

757
02:15:31,127 --> 02:15:32,727
The valves first!

758
02:16:03,207 --> 02:16:05,407
For God's sake, my ship!

759
02:16:23,047 --> 02:16:24,127
Damn it.

760
02:16:24,327 --> 02:16:26,087
Now it's too late.

761
02:19:42,167 --> 02:19:43,647
Do you know what he says?

762
02:19:43,727 --> 02:19:47,007
He says they untied the boat last night.

763
02:19:47,087 --> 02:19:50,567
They knew all along the divine vessel
was only dragged over the mountain...

764
02:19:50,687 --> 02:19:52,767
...so that it could drift
through the rapids.

765
02:19:52,887 --> 02:19:57,447
It had to be done to soothe
the evil spirits of the rapids.

766
02:19:57,527 --> 02:19:59,767
I must stop my ship.

767
02:21:30,647 --> 02:21:33,567
First of all, have a drink.

768
02:21:33,647 --> 02:21:37,287
Running the Pongo das Mortes
with a steamship...

769
02:21:37,367 --> 02:21:40,407
...is a record that will
never be repeated.

770
02:21:40,487 --> 02:21:42,087
Here, have a drink.

771
02:21:43,687 --> 02:21:48,127
Wonderful, gentlemen.
Quite spectacular.

772
02:21:49,327 --> 02:21:53,247
Here's to the reconciliation
of the evil spirits of the Pongo.

773
02:22:05,087 --> 02:22:07,167
I'll tell you a story.

774
02:22:08,567 --> 02:22:11,247
At the time when North America
was hardly explored...

775
02:22:11,807 --> 02:22:15,287
...one of those early French trappers
went westward from Montreal...

776
02:22:17,687 --> 02:22:20,847
...and he was the first white man
to set eyes on Niagara Falls.

777
02:22:22,727 --> 02:22:27,647
When he returned, he told of waterfalls
that were more vast and immense...

778
02:22:27,727 --> 02:22:30,127
...than people had ever dreamed of.

779
02:22:31,687 --> 02:22:33,327
But no one believed him.

780
02:22:33,767 --> 02:22:36,047
They thought he was
a madman or a liar.

781
02:22:38,087 --> 02:22:40,287
They asked him, "What's your proof?"

782
02:22:42,087 --> 02:22:43,687
And he answered...

783
02:22:46,407 --> 02:22:47,807
"My proof is...

784
02:22:50,127 --> 02:22:51,847
...that I have seen them."

785
02:23:01,287 --> 02:23:02,527
Sorry.

786
02:23:03,447 --> 02:23:05,967
I don't really know what that's
got to do with me.

787
02:23:11,847 --> 02:23:13,407
What will you do next?

788
02:23:14,487 --> 02:23:15,687
I don't know.

789
02:23:16,327 --> 02:23:21,487
I'm asking because I'm interested
in buying the boat back.

790
02:23:21,727 --> 02:23:24,687
My business has been
expanding lately.

791
02:23:25,447 --> 02:23:28,367
The damage could be repaired
in a few days.

792
02:23:28,527 --> 02:23:33,727
Oh, I assure you, I don't mean to
exploit your delicate situation.

793
02:23:35,527 --> 02:23:41,887
I just heard, that a European opera
ensemble has arrived in Manaus...

794
02:23:41,967 --> 02:23:44,447
...to give a guest performance there.

795
02:23:44,567 --> 02:23:46,887
Perhaps you should go there.

796
02:23:47,047 --> 02:23:51,487
They are performing an opera of this
fantastic German composer.

797
02:23:51,927 --> 02:23:53,927
One of the very modern ones.

798
02:23:54,047 --> 02:23:58,847
Federico, Roberto... Ricardo...
What's his name, Ricardo...?

799
02:23:58,967 --> 02:24:00,127
Wagner?

800
02:24:00,447 --> 02:24:02,167
He's the one who wrote Parsifal.

801
02:24:02,567 --> 02:24:03,767
Yes, I guess that's the one.

802
02:24:03,967 --> 02:24:06,167
Very Teutonic, his music.

803
02:24:06,247 --> 02:24:09,127
And the name of the Opera
is "The Puritans".

804
02:24:09,727 --> 02:24:12,607
No, no, that's an Italian opera, by Bellini.

805
02:24:18,087 --> 02:24:19,367
Tell me...

806
02:24:21,847 --> 02:24:23,767
...did you mean that about the boat?

807
02:24:26,727 --> 02:24:30,327
Hey, Cholo, Huerequeque,
come over here!

808
02:24:32,887 --> 02:24:34,047
Come on.

809
02:24:36,647 --> 02:24:40,127
Paul, this is the new
owner of the Molly Aida.

810
02:24:40,207 --> 02:24:42,687
But we still have the
ship for two more weeks.

811
02:24:43,367 --> 02:24:46,087
Paul, listen.

812
02:24:48,007 --> 02:24:50,727
You'll travel to Manaus
with all this money.

813
02:24:51,887 --> 02:24:55,527
You'll bring back a tailcoat and
the best cigar in the world.

814
02:24:56,727 --> 02:25:00,127
And from the theater I want
an armchair with red velvet upholstery.

815
02:25:00,207 --> 02:25:03,647
I have to keep a promise to a pig
that loves Caruso so much.

816
02:25:07,607 --> 02:25:10,487
And then...

817
02:25:11,305 --> 02:25:17,250
